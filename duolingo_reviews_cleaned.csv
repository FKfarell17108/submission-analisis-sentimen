A Google user,4,French has 8 sections close to 150 units. Portuguese which is very similar has 4 sections and closer to 50 units. I have premium. Maybe worth it.

A Google user,3,I do like duolingo but there are some issues. I paid for the year of base version. You really only get extra lives and no ads. My biggest issue is they hardly explain anything. Many things don't make sense without at least a basic explanation. You'll realize when you make a mistake it has a link to explain the mistake but you have to pay for the max version. No discount (that I'm seeing) even though I've already bought the base.
