A Google user,1,"Don't waste your time or money on this app, the only way to learn now is to pay. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR HEARTS WHEN YOU COULD PRACTICE TO FILL THEM UP. They don't care about what you have to say, your complaints etc, so saying you don't like something won't matter. Their customer service doesn't exist."

A Google user,5,"Duolingo has become a ubiquitous name in language learning, and for good reason. Its gamified approach, accessibility, and wide range of languages have made it a popular choice for millions seeking to broaden their linguistic horizons. However, like any educational tool, Duolingo has its strengths and weaknesses, which are important to consider when evaluating its effectiveness. One of Duolingo's most significant advantages is its gamification. Turning language learning into a game."
A Google user,5,this help me learn every word in Spanish thanks Duolingo i love Duolingo it is the best ever i just love it thanks Duolingo hope you have fun doing Duolingo.
A Google user,5,This app is fantastic 😍😊

A Google user,5,one the best app
A Google user,3,Teaching the same thing if I get it correct
A Google user,4,"In Ukrainian I am told the accent is not very good. Teaches you ridiculous things. Who needs to say ""no that's not my elephant"" Brilliant at forming a habit though and promoting competitive learning which works for me"
A Google user,5,so far it is easy enough to understand and retain especially due to repititions of even the same words
A Google user,5,great learning platform
A Google user,5,Nice app and interesting
A Google user,5,Children good suggestion platfo rm
A Google user,4,"not bad, should givr it a try"
A Google user,1,"Since last year update I can't use the app, it keeps saying ""offline"" even when I'm online. I uninstalled and reinstalled it and I have missed classes for months. I'm just installing it now again. Same issue"
A Google user,4,little bit expensive to get the ad free/unlimited lives version but still definitely worth the cost
A Google user,4,Fun way to learn languages! Thanks for getting those issues ironed out. Updating my review again.

A Google user,5,bestest
A Google user,5,duolingo reached me to speak Japanese
A Google user,3,"Good for something that is free. The ads are getting bad. I liked the first version MUCH better than what has developed. Sometimes, they don't translate the answer, it just says whether it's correct or not. There's not much learning in that. One of the guys voices irritates me so bad I have to turn the volume down when he talks. Taking away the practice to earn hearts function was a mistake, how are we meant to learn if we can't make mistakes? Lose five hearts and you're done? Stupid."
A Google user,5,I really like the simplicity of it. Super easy to get started.
A Google user,5,You are best duolingo
A Google user,5,Duo Widget is very dramatic. App has lots of features and makes it fun to learn. My German has improved so much since using Duolingo
A Google user,2,"I used to LOVE Duo Lingo lessons. I have at least 12 languages I've started learning bits and pieces of. I love so much about the app, the speaking lessons, the listening lessons... ...but I honestly can't tolerate how Co-Dependent their Duo Mascot is on the Home Screen Widget. It's actually making me feel too depressed to do Duo Lingo lessons because Duo gets SO depressed when I am going through life that keeps me apart from the app. Please cheer up Duo. Nectar attracts more Bees than Vinegar"
A Google user,4,"Generally a good app to learn languages with. Sadly the options for non-english speakers are very limited so if your english isn't good enough to learn a new language based on it, you might not be able to learn the language you want. The ads are okayish by now."
A Google user,5,"This app is a lot better when it comes to learning about languages than Google translate ever will be. keep up the good work, Duo!"
A Google user,5,very nice 👌 👍 👏
A Google user,5,Helped me so much
A Google user,5,very important
A Google user,5,"It's really useful for cross country vacations and stuff if you want to have more fun but it's not like fluency it's like being able to do the essentials like order food somewhere and stuff and I also like the little app icon changes if you dont practice they're pretty funny and clever. Overall this app is useful, fun to use and a lot more positive things."
A Google user,5,its good 👍
A Google user,5,it is so fun
A Google user,5,love it
A Google user,4,"it teaches in a nice slow relaxed way, so you learn at your own pace."

A Google user,5,"very good, they literally made learning fun and way easier"
A Google user,5,this app is good for every student
A Google user,5,It s a good learning app but I don't t expect that Duolingo will collaborate with squid games ☠️💀
A Google user,5,I have learned so much from this app! I hope I can finally speak to my grandparents in polish so they can understand me! Update: I can now speak to my grandparents pretty fluently thank you!!
A Google user,5,very nice 👍

A Google user,5,"I didn't know it was really working until I heard the language being spoken in front of me... even after a long break from practicing. The time I DID put in was worth every bit. When I experienced this, the first thing I did was jump back on and start practicing again. I'm very impressed."
A Google user,5,I love Duolingo this app teach me so much things.
A Google user,5,it's great for learning some words
A Google user,4,best language learning app😊
A Google user,3,I really love duolingo and how it lets you learn very well. Although what confuses me is how it gives access to fictional languages like elvish for example but not languages like tagalog (ive wanted to learn tagalog for a while) and i cant on duolingo. Id love if Duolingo does eventually give access to more languages like Tagalog. When that happens i will absolutely use it more
A Google user,5,very good❤❤

A Google user,2,"I don't appreciate how the translations are inaccurate. While studying Japanese and doing the word match exercise, I came across ""うみ"" and it was matched to ""beach"". Totally wrong. Even if the phrase ""うみにいきます"" (which is the example sentence used) can have the implied meaning of ""going to the beach"", it literally means ""going to the sea"". ""うみ"" means ""sea"". ""はま"" means ""beach"". Come on, guys. Also, ""あめ"" means ""rain"", not ""rainy"". Will more of this kind of misinformation crop up later?"
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,4,great app
A Google user,1,"You can not learn the essential grammar in Russian or any language for which, you'll not understand when the word changes accordingly and will fail over and over again. Bring grammar."

A Google user,5,good learning app
A Google user,5,it's making learning seems too easy and interesting
A Google user,5,Great.....nothing upper then🫡👍👍
A Google user,2,"Let's be honest, it's all about the money : subsciptions. The teaching content and quality has changed over time - not that it was great before, but it was there if one looked - no more grammar tips or explanations, no more comment section or discussion boards. At the free entry level one is obliged to look elsewhere for help and explanations."
A Google user,5,I love this app.This is so useful.🤗😊
A Google user,5,So sweet good game
A Google user,5,Mujhe Korean sikhana bahut pasand haiisase ham log bahut Sare language just Sikh sakte hainaur yah bahut Achcha app haiaur isse to five star hi Hona chahie
A Google user,4,"I would prefer to just study on my own without being in a competition each week with other students. The promotion and demotion system used by Duolingo is not for me. I often feel I do exercises to earn points rather than to learn the language. Duolingo has many positive features, but the completion system app developers have instituted is not to my liking."
A Google user,4,this app is very helpful for learning English
A Google user,5,I am so interested. I hope I will learn English through these duo apps

A Google user,3,very nice
A Google user,2,"I am currently learning German and improving my English at an intermediate level. I’ve noticed that the Duolingo AI video call feature is available on Android in several countries, but unfortunately, it is not yet accessible in India. Given that around 70% of people in India use Android devices due to their affordability, many users are unable to access this valuable feature to practice their speaking skills. In contrast, only a small percentage of people use iPhones."

A Google user,4,"Honestly, it's really good. The only problem is that when im speaking, I literally yell words, and duolingo won't get it! It's so frustrating, and I literally got a 43 in my lesson, I didn't have any background noise, and it was sooooo annoying! Duolingo, PLEASE fix this."
A Google user,5,such a great app for learning many languages
A Google user,5,"I've used Duolingo to sharpen up my Japanese for over a year. It has been an invaluable tool to bring me back up to an acceptable level of Japanese speaking, reading, and some writing. Now I am venturing into Spanish as well."
A Google user,2,"this used to be a 5/5 app. They took away so many features like the community chat, and they stuffed it with adds that it made it less of a tool and more of a cash grab."
A Google user,5,it's really good app's to learn language
A Google user,5,it's so super app to learn languages
A Google user,4,Revolutionary app!....... BUT: I wish they would allow people to choose either a Streak Score or an Accumulative Score for people who dont need to be opening the app every day. I pay for DuoLingo+! I should have the right to choose to skip however long I want and just earn days when I use the app.
A Google user,5,Definitely would recommend if you are looking to learn new languages
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,"Duo did NOT force me to write a good review. 😌 They are very sweet, and I'm actually getting really good with my Spanish. I'm also in competition with my little sister so it's nice that we can both see each others progress."

A Google user,4,The only thing that's I didn't like was that you can't learn māori (New Zealand language) but learning other languages is fun and challenging at the same time.
A Google user,4,My only complaint is the commercials. However I can't complain because I am opting out of purchasing the upgrade. This is a fun way of learning a new language. My daughter and I are encouraging each other. Bueno
A Google user,4,We can learn very easily using our phone

A Google user,5,"Duolingo is the perfect app to learn different languages and is fun you can add friends and family .There are so many languages to learn this includes math, music, Arabic, Spanish and so much more this app makes learning more languages fun and not too hard. I personally like Duolingo because barely any adds and fun I normally don't give apps 5 Stars or write long reviews if you're want or need to learn another language I prefer Duolingo."
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,3,osm 👍
A Google user,5,An easy way to learn a new language.
A Google user,4,I love it it a lot !!!!!! A BIG QUESTION??: why did this application had spread a lot of fear in everyone who are using it? Youtubers had all creating videos to avoid the app by saying It is dangerous. And one thing that the steak. If missed a day it keep on messaging and neglect the user by irritating messages. It always keeps main eye on streaks and challenges but not in language procedure.
A Google user,5,Excellent in regular use.
A Google user,5,duolingo app is very good for schools Student
A Google user,4,Great app you should make it possible to chat with other people in your streaks like texting
A Google user,5,better than some of the more popular apps I've used
A Google user,5,It's kind of fun
A Google user,5,I like duo
A Google user,5,"it's is perfect for language, reading, and writing"
A Google user,4,Really helpful!!!
A Google user,5,is helpful.
A Google user,5,"the best app,, learn to english"
A Google user,5,The Best 🫡😎
A Google user,3,"Deeply frustrating at times. There are questions where the hints given are incorrect, which does not help with learning the right translation at all. It also doesn't help that the rules of grammar don't get explained, so I never quite know why a word is or isn't supposed to be in a particular place in a sentence. I'm learning, but I feel like I'm not understanding."
A Google user,5,"People may think that Duolingo is bad, but it's really not when you learn languages it's a new thing and on Duolingo you have something to work for like the Monthly challenges that you have to do and the leaderboard I mean this is probably my favorite language app out there. Thanks Duolingo! Especially you Duo."
A Google user,5,The Extra points earned do NOT always add on to my points. said I gained 25 xp points and they do not add on to my points. sometimes the points add on and many times they do not.
A Google user,5,Duolingo is my perfect learning platform
A Google user,5,very good👍
A Google user,5,very useful 👍
A Google user,1,"Every update gamifies the app. Expect the same exact sentences, over and over again. This used be a decent app but now there are 2 paid tiers, the first one just lets you make as many mistakes as you want and the second one uses ai. This is not the app to learn a language with. Don't waste your time or money."
A Google user,5,nice 👍
A Google user,5,work app good 😊👍
A Google user,5,a learning language apps at it best
A Google user,5,جميل جدا
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,5,this is the best app to learn any language 💯🎖️
A Google user,5,I started with the free thing but ended up buying a family subscription. so far we're all really enjoying it. it's only been two weeks but we can say little things now. give us a few months and we'll have lots to say in Spanish
A Google user,5,Best learning app ❤️❤️❤️
A Google user,1,They make it to hard unless you pay
A Google user,5,love this app. definitely recommend using a language textbook to accompany your journey
A Google user,5,great 👍
A Google user,5,I'm learning something
A Google user,3,It's a good app when you download but when you go to uninstall and unsubscribe the emails continue to come through which can be annoying and frustrating
A Google user,1,"I had a great time using Duo with a streak of over 1100 days, and a couple of years before that. Tried the paid version, but the limitations of the free version helped me to learn. A recent change now means that as a free user, you no longer receive explanations of why your answer is wrong, nor do you have the ability to freely practice previously learned grammar and vocabulary. Duo is no longer a free learning app. The free version has been reduced to being a trial for the paid version"
A Google user,5,really really nice it helps me in Japanese and can teach you any language you can learn it for fun too.
A Google user,5,useful to learn!
A Google user,5,this is amazing app dont know why I didn't start sooner
A Google user,5,I have learned faster than I expected. I am learning Japanese and I thought it would get too complicated when it came to learning the characters but I can read and write any hirigana and I have learned a lot of Kanji. It's a very engaging app and a clever methodology. I look forward to increasing my skills and in time taking on another language.
A Google user,5,good

A Google user,5,"A few weeks into learning Japanese. It's getting a bit tough and exciting. And I hope I don't have to update this review in the future. But Duolingo has done a good job keeping me focused so far. It's been a busy few weeks but the gamification with the day wise streaks and simple quests every day, I'm managing to eek out a few minutes even on my busiest days just to stay consistent. All in all - so far so good. Let's hope I'm conversationally fluent - at least passably - by some time next year."
A Google user,5,"very interesting, nice tutoring 😁"
A Google user,5,Duolingo is the best
A Google user,5,it is Soo good
A Google user,4,very excellent 👌👌👍
A Google user,5,very good classss
A Google user,1,ai sucks for actually learning language. 2021 and before Duolingo was so much better
A Google user,5,Duolingo is very smart study in game
A Google user,2,Auto hard refill will increase the number of readers and also give a lot of pleasure to read. So it would have been better if the auto hard refill was done dear Duolingo member. Thank You
A Google user,4,"Hello I personally love duolingo because if you want to lean languages...THIS IS THE APP FOR YOU!And you can kean more than one language and lean fast and easy by breaking down words,characters, or signs!I'm learning Korean and I've been on this app for 6 days and I'm already half way through section 2,nationalitys!So if you want to lean a language try Duolingo!"
A Google user,5,the app offers all the necessary language learning techniques
A Google user,5,Make it easy for me to learn other languages.. forever learning with Duolingo!
A Google user,5,very Good
A Google user,5,very super app
A Google user,4,farther the streaks the more grammar they provide
A Google user,5,this is very great 👏aap i love it ❤
A Google user,3,"It used to be fun and had me looking forward to each lesson. However, the latest update (late 2022) is absolutely horrendous! The CEO is being given feedback, but he has openly said he's NOT going to change anything back! He's definitely NOT listening to the longtime users. This is not good! Duolingo used to champion user comments, but it doesn't look like they do anymore. Change it back! UPDATE: It's hard to finish Quest, when some of the lessons don't load! I've tried others devices."
A Google user,5,I love it because I learned so mush French and so did my mom
A Google user,5,"This is the most Funniest, Fun, and Most Entertaining app ever. It also challenges you and you probably like challenges and there are contests too."
A Google user,5,best English teacher
A Google user,5,very good to the language skills
A Google user,5,it so easy I stay on my streak thank to the developer for making the app
A Google user,4,I Love how this helps me get to learn Chinese (DON'T COME FOR ME BUT I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT MY STREAK!!!!!!)
A Google user,5,love it
A Google user,5,it makes learning fun.
A Google user,5,5 star rating
A Google user,5,this game is helpful
A Google user,3,"So far I'm enjoying the german language course. unfortunately, I feel harassed by the application. If you purchase Duolingo Pro, instead of seeing ads for other things they force you to see ads for Duolingo Max and it's just as annoying. Also there's no way of turning on the streak tracking and the league scoring which are extremely annoying to have to sit through. Will not repurchase the Pro in future years."
A Google user,5,very cool to learn
A Google user,4,"Don't enjoy that you have hearts, but other than that It is a good app."
A Google user,1,Very slow app technical issues too much time wast in opening.(i buy full premium but app shows continuously adds i want to hate duo but I'm addicted by my course till 2021)
A Google user,5,super
A Google user,5,very good an i learned about japanes e very well thanks duolingo😉😉
A Google user,1,"Some answer buttons are not work it's irritating 😔 please chage it , it's didn't allow to move next level"
A Google user,5,good for learn new languange.
A Google user,3,the hearts system is annoying
A Google user,4,"podrían añadir un botón que sea para aclarar dudas o explicar algo nuevamente mientras se hace la lección, por ejemplo , yo no entendí por qué iba el ""do"" en las preguntas, y tuve que buscar por otros medios para aclarar la duda, pero, con un botón (por ejemplo [!]) que sirva para aclarar dudas, hubiese entendido mejor y más rápido."
A Google user,5,parfect game 😍😍😍😍😜😜😜
A Google user,5,The best to learn all languages
A Google user,5,really good for learning small words and nice to remember
A Google user,5,cold and hot

A Google user,1,"The app is trash, better to use it on web with ad blocker. Constantly bombarding you with Super Duolingo ads after every session. Money hungry mr Duo."
A Google user,5,learn more
A Google user,4,I JUST GET MAD WHEN I LOSE A HEART BUT I LOVE THIS LEARNING APP
A Google user,5,very nice 👍
A Google user,5,"Quite fun and Competitive.. But actually, It's too fun, I have no idea How to really understand each sentences use for daily life situation, It's like I have to learn a lot of it So I can take a step further with so much vocabulary I need to work on.. Overall, It's really Good"
A Google user,5,a wonderful app
A Google user,5,nice app
A Google user,5,wow mujhe angraygi aa gai
A Google user,5,"Slow steps and lots of repetition. Encourages writing, reading and listening skills. Love this app."
A Google user,5,best
A Google user,5,Great learning platform if you're willing to give a little time.
A Google user,5,honestly a great way to get into rhythm!!!
A Google user,3,the speaking option isn't working. There is not enough explanation of when and how to use the different forms of words.
A Google user,5,easy to learn and animations are cute 😀
A Google user,5,Absolute cinema
A Google user,3,it's.a pretty food app but I still don't understand a lot of stuff I need to

A Google user,4,very nice learning app 🙂 (the owl is cute)
A Google user,4,love your site. Duolingo is fantastic!
A Google user,3,"Edit: Removed 2 stars because app is glitchy. Hard to move to next lesson because the screen blanks out. Leaderboard results blank out and when pressing a word in Word Bank, the word doesn't go to the top line, it falls by the green Checked button. Please fix asap. Easy to use. Fun to learn. Keeps you motivated to learn and practice each day with interactive game like features to keep you interested in learning. Love it. Gracias!"
A Google user,5,I hate the hearts function...but I guess how else are they gonna get you to buy the plus version... There's also not too many adds
A Google user,4,some of the direct translations are a bit off but still a great way to learn another language!
A Google user,5,I learned so much by this app
A Google user,4,I'm doing well. helping a lot
A Google user,5,very nice
A Google user,5,mast hai
A Google user,5,"it's great for learning English, it improves my english faster than I learn in school. A very useful app!"
A Google user,5,i lub duolingo ɛ:
A Google user,5,it invigorates the mind.
A Google user,5,"suka banget sama apk inii, bener² membantu dan belajar gaperlu bayar"
A Google user,4,id have to say it is enjoyable but i have a nitpick and its the lack of other slavic languages particularly serbian if u guys could possibly include this with the app that be great plz address this thank you.
A Google user,3,"Nice for learning basics, but I keep getting kicked out of speaking exercises, and the leader board won't load, so I can't see my position or do the match madness and ramp up challenges. Not a very well maintained app overall. Some of these nudges are really rude, too."
A Google user,5,grate learning app what I have seen. I learn every day 15 minutes per day at least.
A Google user,3,"It's good for starters. If you do one lesson a day just to keep your streak, it takes a while to complete one level. It's very repetitive. You just practice the same words and only learn like 4-5 new words each level. Also, the reminders are very annoying. Every week or two, even if you don't continue your streak, you get a reminder. And if you do, it reminds you every day 1-3 times. Overall, it's good for learning basic words and phrases unless you're willing to do it for a very long time."
A Google user,5,I love duolingo cause it teaches you how to speak a language
A Google user,2,"After you complete a lesson, a big ad pops up, and you can't close out of it. The only way out, is to completely close the app, and start over. Please fix this! It's so frustrating!"
A Google user,5,I love it it's helps me learn Spanish I wish u could learn the Cambodia language
A Google user,5,teaches a lot. I mean a lot try.

A Google user,1,"None of the speaking exercises work on my phone, even though Duolingo has full microphone permissions"
A Google user,5,if it wasn't for Duolingo I couldn't know what my family is saying 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 💚💚💚
A Google user,1,"Recently I experienced a bug and didn't get fixed, and made me lose my one week streak."
A Google user,5,it helps me learn different languages

A Google user,5,"it's helped me learn Japanese, and I love it"
A Google user,5,Duolingo has been both enjoyable and informative! It's helped me keep up with my Spanish!
A Google user,5,"Doulingo is an WONERFUL app that helps me speak and communicate with other Spanish people! ¿¿¿Hola, cómo estás???"
A Google user,1,"Before the last update, you could practice to earn back hearts but that option has been removed. It defeats the purpose of being a learning app when a learning tool is being replaced by a cash grab. Please return the practice option!"
A Google user,5,this is a BIG opportunity to learn something new and this is such a really fun thing to do
A Google user,5,sweet
A Google user,5,Very simple app to navigate. The lessons are clear and offer many helpful tools to learn. It's actually made so that it's fun to learn a new language. I am currently learning two languages simultaneously at my own pace.

A Google user,1,"Listen here buckaroo, stop giving me words you didn't teach me!! I am STRUGGLING over here, and I had one more thing thing to complete my lesson to get my streak, and I accidentally closed out, and NOW IT RESTARTED"
A Google user,1,"Awful, you only get reminded 2 days before your free trial ends, no additional heads up atleast a few hours before it ends. The notifications are pretty useless as it doesn't show you on the app either. I've just been charged 60 pounds for being one day late to cancelling. How to end the trial is really unclear aswell. I'm disappointed."
A Google user,5,"it's easy, fun, and motivating when you learn your languages!"
A Google user,5,very good experience...but too much pub
A Google user,5,I have to give this app a five star rating because I don't wanna get on Duo's bad side
A Google user,5,"amazing,not explanation #1 learning app ever"
A Google user,5,veryyyy good
A Google user,5,مفيد جدا 💓
A Google user,5,Duolingo is an app that makes language learning interesting. You can be sure to gain a lot from this app
A Google user,5,"This app is amazing for language learning I have done French so well because of Duolingo like I have done so well in Spanish,German,Music and Math and more.Never lost a day."
A Google user,5,good fun I first found it when I wanted to learn polish
A Google user,5,I didn't like the style of learning where you're plunged into quizzes before being given notes but actually? It's not bad.
A Google user,5,"very good and fun app to learn a language. though keep in mind, this won't make you fluent."
A Google user,4,Nice
A Google user,5,Really easy & enjoyable way to learn or practice a language. The social aspect makes it a fun experience.
A Google user,4,"I really like this app, and it will help me learn different languages for fun. Right now, I am learning Korean. I just need to do my lessons on time.....I would rate it 4.5, but I can't, or I just don't know how😑"
A Google user,5,"7 year streak, I'm essentially married to this app now. But I can speak to my in laws because of it!"
A Google user,4,pretty fun

A Google user,5,Very very helpful
A Google user,5,So fun my kid learned so much from it now she can speak just like use we speak Spanish she can say mucho custo
A Google user,5,Duolingo is the best French app every 🥰 love you
A Google user,1,It's getting worse and worse. - It's telling you that you have earned double XP but will not give it to you. - I have probably finished Italian lessons as it's not coming up with anything new and it only allows me 6 It lessons in 24 hrs. - And in Spanish.. There is that where I have to fill 3 verbs but it's blocking the 3rd one and the only option is to quit game. - I have a huge list but I am only allowed to write under 500 characters. Concluzion: I stopped recommending it. It's a waste of time
A Google user,1,"I have to watch just under two and a half minutes of adverts for every exercise I complete. Thats no incentive to come back every day. I know youre trying to get me to pay for the app and take out the adds, but this is ridiculous"
A Google user,5,Very helpful... 👍🏾
A Google user,4,Interesting
A Google user,3,"You can't spam lessons one after another, because the XP will NOT count towards the leaderboards. Had x3 XP, so I was able to do at LEAST 7 lessons equalling to over 300 XP only to find I was only counted for 110 XP. Please look into this. It's a little disheartening."
A Google user,5,Awesome app i recommend it
A Google user,5,i learned over 10 spanish words in twenty minutes... thats crazy bro
A Google user,5,"app doing it's best to make me learn 😂,, tq duolingo developers"
A Google user,5,music is very fun and it's good for education
A Google user,5,muito bom.. melhor aplicativo de inglês
A Google user,5,Great for beginners!
A Google user,4,"i like it, but i cant say it about being fun"
A Google user,5,it really worth my time 😀
A Google user,5,nice Duolingo family
A Google user,5,Duo is like a friend🥰.Helps you learn step by step.I took one of those said to be hard languages but am doing pretty great🥳.Am impressed.I can't really afford the premium one yet but imma make an effort to for sure😉.
A Google user,5,"A really put-together app for learning, I recommend."
A Google user,5,"Its the absolute best learning game ever you guys have to download it,it's literally so amazing👍🏾❤️"
A Google user,4,It's the best language app I have ever used
A Google user,5,I llove the frozen streaks.
A Google user,1,I'm actually kind of sad about this AP's changes. The features for learning and the hearts are just not cool. The inability to learn on a free app sucks. You can't keep your streaks if you fail even though you're logged in it acts like you didn't do a lesson. Failed lessons is STILL logging in and trying. Totally uncool.
A Google user,5,Excellent Language Platform 👌
A Google user,5,because i love it
A Google user,1,It's almost impossible to study with this application due to the many ads. Also every time you make a single mistake and you have no hearts left you are taken back to practice for a heart. The worst application ever!! Unbelievable!
A Google user,5,it helps me Arabic so I can talk Arab to my crush Samira
A Google user,5,"This app is great! It's thorough with the lessons, simple to use, enjoyable and fun! I also like how if you answer a question wrong it will explain why (in the paid version when trials are offered)!"
A Google user,5,"Duolingo rocks. it makes learning a language very fun, and the competitive elements keeps me engaged"
A Google user,5,IT IS FAN-TASTIC I LOVE IT. ITS SO GOOD
A Google user,4,"Great, but i have a problem with the leaderboard. suddenly it doesn't load . it has been going on for a week now"
A Google user,4,very helpful 👌
A Google user,4,French has 8 sections close to 150 units. Portuguese which is very similar has 4 sections and closer to 50 units. I have premium. Maybe worth it. I started off non paid years ago and even though they cap you at 5 mistakes a day it was still doable but you probably won't be progressing on the higher leaderboards. Unpaid version has ads that are WAY TOO Loud esp w/ headphones (which they recommend). The load times for lessons are a bit lengthy. They double Paywalled a mistake explanation section.
A Google user,5,I can learn polish 🇵🇱!
A Google user,5,nice app to try out. it does teach and easy to follow the instructions
A Google user,5,"it's a good app, no glitches. The only thing I would say is that losing heart makes me mad sometimes, but it also makes it addicting and you can always get unlimited version"
A Google user,5,👍
A Google user,5,Hello I forgot cancel my subscribe can you canceled my subscribe please
A Google user,5,it's really fun when I downloaded this i new russin like boom!
A Google user,4,Very fun to learn with my daughter loves it and loves keeping her streaks. It does keep repeating the same way to teach new words.
A Google user,5,it's great I'm really enjoying learning language with this app
A Google user,5,"awesome، fine, best revision,"
A Google user,5,its really helping app to boost up my fluence in English . i am still practicing this daily .. wow. ita marvelous .. keep it up ...
A Google user,4,it's a great way to increase your vocabulary and understand basic grammar concepts
A Google user,5,a ten out of ten! I almost lost my streak in resulting in my family getting kidnapped by Duolingo.
A Google user,4,nice app
A Google user,1,"Duo was 5 stars but ever since the Feb. 2025 update, you can not practice (old lessons) to regain hearts in the base game (free version). Hence I've lowered my review to 1 star. It will remain that way until the company decides to undo their update."
A Google user,5,Perfect 😘
A Google user,3,I have been using duo on and off since it was still a fully free app. I currently pay for plus and am frustrated. The speaking componant of the app has not been working for over a month. I've sent countless error reports and multiple emails to tech support with no response. It's hard to justify paying for something that used to be free many years ago when it's not working and I am receiving no assistance. It's a bummer becuase I have learned a lot.
A Google user,5,good 👍🏻
A Google user,2,"It's fun, alright. Then, it becomes very discouraging when you earn just a quarter of the points you've earned(90 but get 20 points) 👎👎👎👎"
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,4,Es ist sehr gut und es hat mir auch geholfen jetzt französisch zu lernen ich kann es euch nur empfehlen.
A Google user,1,The app has gone so much worse. Each and every update makes it worse as a free user.
A Google user,5,This is the best app for learning new language. I love everything about the app
A Google user,5,wonderful app I like how it makes you speak it after the third lesson in each language
A Google user,5,"I love it it's so fun,easy, and engaging for me to learn not only languages but also math and music! There's one thing I wanna ad to it which is the language in the Philippines 🇵🇭 I hope we can add it I'll love it.😊🤩"
A Google user,5,good application
A Google user,5,"it's such a good app for learning new languages, music, and even maths. I really love this app I have recommended it to so many friends and we have battles to see who can get the highest streak.(I am winning btw with a streak of 103 days) Me and my friends can rate this app soo highly trust me it's such a good app. If you wanna battle your friends in streaks try this instead of Snapchat streaks and plus you learn at the same time. Thank u"
A Google user,5,nice app
A Google user,5,wonderful teacher i love you duolingo
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,5,very nice pace to learn a new language we'll designed app
A Google user,2,"There is no rhyme or reason for how the languages work. Some have phonetical ways to help you, others you are on your own. The way some words are spoken to you do not reflect on how they are priperly announced, at least not enough for the app to pick up on what it is you are saying. The only reason it gets the 2 stars is being free. This app is very limited though and you will have to find other means of learning later on"
A Google user,5,Very good at teaching languages across the globe 🌎 5 ⭐
A Google user,5,"I like the superduolingo thing ,but i think that everyone should have it for free. Great app tho🩷"
A Google user,1,Double stacking ads might be the most annoying thing this app could ever have.
A Google user,5,"very good, I just need duo to upgrade the avatars options, thx"
A Google user,5,I'm loving it so far!!
A Google user,5,I wish I could show you screenshots to let you know about something wrong
A Google user,5,I love it and if I'm mad I can just learn German
A Google user,5,wonderful app teaches wonderful learning skills and you can practice for sometime even when offline Truly wonderful
A Google user,5,the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A Google user,5,best recommend😇
A Google user,5,"The only complaints I have are: so many ads, omg! I lose interest in using the app when I have to sit through 4+ ads after each lesson, and the lessons are super short. I can do a lesson in less time than the ads run. AND: Don't guilt trip and degrade me into practicing. Ugh, I hate that. Rude. Have an option or something to choose how you coax us into practicing. Your characters are terrible. Yuck. You could use some options there too. I don't want some rude girl as a teacher, etc."
A Google user,5,"Esta bien la app porque puedes aprender hasta miles de idiomas y eso me gusta, yo practique inglés desde hace 2 meses y ya se mucho el ingles."
A Google user,3,diventa un pó noiosa dopo un certo punto imparare una lingua.. gli esercizi dovrebbero essere più stimolanti. Mi piace la parte della musica però anche se la tastiera virtuale non è come quella fisica
A Google user,3,Good but sometimes its langweilig
A Google user,5,like this game
A Google user,5,the best app ever
A Google user,5,very helpfull danke shion

A Google user,5,you are so cool duolingo because of you i can now speak Japanese thank you Duolingo 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
A Google user,5,"I like this app alot because the Ted talk that I heard about it , made me feel homely and true sincerity here , but I didn't like that it too tried to sell a subscription but huh that's just my own stupidity , ofc everybody needs to make money"
A Google user,1,This app is not for urdu speaking person. How ridiculous. I am very disappointed
A Google user,4,too much Duolingo max advertising
A Google user,5,"this app is amazing, I'm currently learning French, and my streak is on fire. I'm learning new words, how to pronounce and d say them in sentences. I totally recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn a new language, I feel like they should kinda put more african languages bcz the only south african language there is Zulu what about the other 10(it's 11 plus sign language but im not sure if that counts) but overall it's a very good app"
A Google user,5,bombastic 🎉
A Google user,5,Great way to learn another language while having fun
A Google user,5,amazing
A Google user,3,"polish language: excellent for review and repetition. poor in vocab introduction ... start with nominative examples then move to other examples. also, not much explanation of reason for spelling/case usage. need other resources to fill in gaps."
A Google user,5,such a great app
A Google user,5,amazing game I learned German now
A Google user,5,"so expertise, love it and duo is cute."

A Google user,5,"Wonderful app, they teach you everything from writing characters to pronouncing the words correctly."
A Google user,5,"It's been six active months on Duolingo learning Kiswahili. I must admit that I'm not able to speak well but I'm much better than I was. The Ads on the free version are bearable. Once in a while, it gives me three free days of super. I highly recommend it"
A Google user,3,thank you
A Google user,5,thank you for your help duolingo
A Google user,5,it's avery important app because it help you to learn any language
A Google user,5,"this bird ate my family when i missed 2 days of italian lessons. it was for my grandma's funeral, and it still did it"
A Google user,5,Lovely 😍
A Google user,3,adds block you out from doing your lessons.
A Google user,5,it lovely and free you don't even have to pay I already know lots of Spanish
A Google user,5,فخم
A Google user,3,Bad quality and a lot of adds. But good for children.
A Google user,5,Very good helps me lern French 🍟 write the world down 👇 and write how you pronounce white the English word then write the other language word use Google translate for extra help do it for a year and you should master whatever language you're learning 1 billion out a billion stars for Google translate And Duolingo if you're learning a new language read this comment and this should help you learn a new language.
A Google user,4,es bueno
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,3,can't practice to get lives back
A Google user,5,its really good for me
A Google user,2,"Really annoying to use, constantly loses your rewards so you lose all you've worked for. I'm paying for this app so others can have it for free, it should at least work properly. My kids stopped using it because they find it so irritating."
A Google user,5,best app ever
A Google user,5,Nice
A Google user,1,"Very irritating to find you can't get past a request to pay. The next time it happens, I'll revert to my BBC French course & delete Duolingo."
A Google user,5,I like it
A Google user,5,it's sigma
A Google user,5,duo is the best app to learn you could learn English a Spanish maths music and other languages

A Google user,3,it's good but too harsh
A Google user,5,It’s very much beneficial.❤️
A Google user,4,Truly this is a amazing app for learning any language.. ❤️‍🩹
A Google user,2,"Subs. App went through the motions for subscription nothing happened. So do I try it again? Hmm.....also why can't you turn off vibrate for a few patronisong pics of diamonds, treat people like adults please. Also I can't tell in the cartoons what a girl in your minds is supposed to look like. All very right on, but no so practical. Sorry, honest opinion."
A Google user,5,this app is very useful and helpfull..... I like this app
A Google user,4,too much helpful
A Google user,1,"Generally, I don't like the app. I will continue using it, but it's not good. The ads placing is designed to make you pay for no ads. Also, they really only let you do lessons unless you pay for more. It's not good for learning an entire language and lies about stuff a lot. It is designed to make you click to pay. An example of a lie is that when you run out of hearts, it tells you to refill for 450 diamonds. But when you go out of the lesson and click on your hearts, it says to refill for 350."
A Google user,5,superb
A Google user,5,I can learn high vilarian here it is so cool

A Google user,5,very nice
A Google user,5,very versatile very good
A Google user,3,to expensive for me to do a monthly subscription. if you have the money it seems decent. if they taught a language for a set price even if it only lasted 5 years would work better.
A Google user,5,"Duolingo is very helpful well I am trying to learn French! It challenges me, but not so hard that I can't do it! I can also pick meany different leagues to learn. Duolingo also saprots me and reminds me to keep up with my daily streak!!!! Definitely recamend it!"

A Google user,4,"Duolingo is an great app to learn new languages, I've learned 250 words in just a couple weeks. The one problem is that if you loose all you hearts its rlly enjoying. ether you wait 5h or do an exercise that takes 5 minutes"

A Google user,5,Really nice and useful app. I am leaning English with this.
A Google user,5,It's really helpful for me. help me to learn Chinese and English faster than I ever imagined
A Google user,2,"This application is good for enriching the one's vocabulary and pronunciation.However it's demotivating sometimes when you're trying to reach a high XP points to advance in the next leagues,(I got to the finals of diamond stage level and when I started doing my courses I found that I was eliminated despite advancing as top 7 in the semifinals) The glitches and the app errors makes it counterproductive in addition of the limited hearts that is no longer available for you to earn 5 full hearts."
A Google user,4,It's really good
A Google user,5,this is a great app to use for home school
A Google user,5,it is a really good game to learn I have learned a lots of things
A Google user,5,Nice app
A Google user,5,enjoying ♥️♥️
A Google user,5,good app 👍 and I increase my language skills you are trying this app 🗣️
A Google user,5,"The best learning app there is ,I have learnt over 4 languages with this.Thank you to the makers of Duolingo."
A Google user,3,I do like duolingo but there are some issues. I paid for the year of base version. You really only get extra lives and no ads. My biggest issue is they hardly explain anything. Many things don't make sense without at least a basic explanation. You'll realize when you make a mistake it has a link to explain the mistake but you have to pay for the max version. No discount (that I'm seeing) even though I've already bought the base. You would think basic explanations would be included at least.
A Google user,4,Best
A Google user,5,"it was very good,!"
A Google user,5,really it's very useful but I want Malayalam language 😢
A Google user,5,this application is very good please add Urdu language in application this is very helpful for us

A Google user,5,my favorite app 🙃 and my english teacher 🤷‍♂️ apps notification is my fully focus in the practice 😊
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,5,"great for helping to learn language, only duolingo related ads-skippable after like 5/10 seconds-rarely get ads though! takes things slow, has reminders of past things you learned, i find it amazing, far better than other language apps, free! turns what would be boring, hard work into a fun game with stories and interactable games in between. has daily streaks-friend streaks too! help s with speech aswell as words/word order!!"
A Google user,5,🥰🥰
A Google user,5,Duolingo is very interesting and good for learning many languages and I'm hare learning english 🥰😄😊

A Google user,5,"it's a fun way to learn another language so far. I have noticed you kind of have to figure out what each word means but then they hammer it into repetition. also considering the language i speak and the one I'm attempting to learn are both germanic, it's fairly easy to figure out, however some kind of lessons or initial hey this is the word we're focusing on and what it means, could be helpful for other languages that are nothing alike."
A Google user,5,Very good app! It's easy to learn any language in this app.
A Google user,5,verygood for people
A Google user,5,kafi acha application h esse english sikhne me mddd milti h
A Google user,1,"I used to love this app and I am in diamond league with 500+ days but this app is really starting to disappoint me as I can't even use practice to earn hearts unless i have used all 5 and even so can only get 1 which doesn't make sense provided we r learning a whole new language, The feature was not only useful to get hearts but also practice as it asked questions i have learnt already, It is just becoming more unfriendly to unpaid user with more features being removed and bugs added!!!!!!"
A Google user,5,"🎀♥I liked it to an indescribable degree, I loved me, teaching me beautiful things and benefiting from it a lot"
A Google user,5,Cool way to motivate people to learn.

A Google user,5,"Duolingo has truly transformed the way I learn new languages. With its engaging and interactive approach, the app makes language addictive. The lessons are well-structured and the variety of exercises keeps me motivated to practice daily. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to embark on a language learning journey!"

A Google user,5,it boosted my education in school
A Google user,4,The Good: Spanish to CEFR B2 - Amazing! Recently increased the Comprehensible Input for the courses. Wish all the common languages were at the same level. The Bad: it seems that every update tries to squeeze more money out of the users. Being a free user is frustrating and difficult intentionally. Also so many glitches and bugs. Always something new. XP credit errors (says you get 60 XP...gives you 10) is the most frustrating!
A Google user,5,its good
A Google user,5,So good for learning language
A Google user,5,"This app is highly recommended for English learners of all levels, It's truly one of the best."

A Google user,3,Endless ads which distract from learning. it would be a useful app otherwise. I find a quit using it after a few days after trying again out of sheer annoyance.
A Google user,2,it's good but there is only one week free rest is paid Duolingo please try not to take a paid after a week if the person wants to learn he/she will learn but what if they can't give money to the aap .You should think about poor people please try to understand
A Google user,4,good for easy learning 👌 👍
A Google user,5,This app is very helpful for learning different various language i personally love this app
A Google user,5,interesting 😁💚🦉
A Google user,2,Generally is ok but every so often some lessons with really gross errors pop out Edit: The structure of the lessons are not well schemmed and the learning methods are poorly thought out at best. Best case scenario you use it to learn some useful phrases and some vocabulary. You vaguely grasp a solid grammar concept

I've been learning German and I have been so into it! The stories were funny especially ""To the railway Station"". While learning in the app, you shouldn't miss a day or some lessons! If you do, Duo will kidnap your parents, some of your family members or even your whole family!(Joke!)."

A Google user,4,this app is good for basic learner
A Google user,4,a bit repeat the exercises
A Google user,4,you should not add characters in this app instead of characters you can add pencil paper etc.. and the sound when we complete a task in a row is too bad you should delete it.it will better without any music there otherwise app is good.

I hope the developer see this feedback and added support for good experience and also good learning /// Love Duolingo, thank you ( 112 streaks because of you )"

A Google user,5,makes learning so fun and engaging. I'm never bored.
A Google user,5,super 💜
A Google user,4,"They should also increase the time for super duolingo the 3 days free thing to five days. I can't make any progress within 3 days. And it is not a good way to advertise. And I think the freeze for streak, there should be more not only 2. Also they need to teach numbers first in some languages. Not only that, now they have disabled the part where it says practice to earn hearts. Pls consider this. 🙏🏽"
A Google user,4,best way of teaching thanks Duolingo 😚
A Google user,5,this is a very good app i am learning korean frim india

A Google user,1,Why this game have LGBT content??
A Google user,1,it told me it would kill me because i did 1 mistake in a whole year..
A Google user,5,super and good 👍
A Google user,3,"there are a lot of mistakes in both languages, but I can say for sure in the language of the learners. and I don't need to learn how to spell peoples names, that's ridiculous"
A Google user,5,"A great tool to supplement the learning process (formal knowledge of, for example, verb tenses should come from elsewhere). You can do Duo lessons at your own pace, which prevents stress!"
A Google user,5,i love this app
A Google user,5,perfecto
A Google user,5,this app is very nice
A Google user,5,it's really interesting and I like very much this app
A Google user,2,It's bad cuz I can't add more word sometimes or something went wrong

A Google user,5,the best app to learn any language 👌 🙌 👏
A Google user,5,Very nice language learning app superb
A Google user,5,super
A Google user,3,"Why does it feel like I've been tested on the same 15 to 20 words ""you're about to forget"" for the last 2 months? It's getting very boring and seems wasteful and pointless. Something wrong with the algorithm?"
A Google user,5,love it it is amazing I am going to learn Chinese so easily it has colourful things and I focus more this is absolutely amazing I love it so much
A Google user,2,The quality of the courses varies greatly. There are quite some bugs to deal with.
A Google user,3,"OKish app, but I find having to write and spell correctly somewhat difficult and unnecessary, when all I want to do is have a simple conversation in Polish. Also finding I can talk about an old fish and other random stuff, when I havent been introduced to everyday words and phrases - ie hello, goodbye, please and thank you. Even knowing how to count would be more productive than what I am learning. Not worth the 50 odd quid a year."
A Google user,5,very well 👏
A Google user,4,"Great, the audio has some issues where it didn't heard what I said many times over especially in the specific audio lessons. No problem in the regular lessons though with the audio"
A Google user,5,I think that this aap is so awesome to improve english skills

A Google user,4,wonderful app
A Google user,5,great game for learning
A Google user,5,wow
A Google user,5,I don't want duolingo sad
A Google user,1,They are consistently unable to have the audio match the correct reading of kanji in the Japanese course. Even the audio for the question and answer to the same problem won't be consistent. Like listening problems will constantly have different audio for the answer.
A Google user,5,amazing 😍
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,"Okay,i rated it 5 stars can you let me out of your basement now ,duo?"
A Google user,5,i love this app its so easy to learn new Language!!
A Google user,5,it is so much fun learning every language I really appreciate doulingo
A Google user,1,"A pp thinks I'm China based, so it stuck with +86 country prefix. Not sure how to let Duo know that I'm Australian and have never been to China. Some languages have limited learning models, e,g Finnish"
A Google user,3,"Duolingo needs learning units on structured grammer (e.g., tenses such as ""present"", ""present progressive"", ""past"", etc.)."
A Google user,5,i have really liked this app it's so easy for me to learn the languages 🥰
A Google user,5,great 👍😃 good 👍😊
A Google user,4,"really good and easy to use, but some of the pronunciation is slightly off (learning Hindi)"
A Google user,5,very nice app 👍
A Google user,5,Very useful
A Google user,2,"I selected the intermediate level in English, but I ran into an issue. Every time I reach the listening test, no matter how many times I tap or how high I turn up the volume, I can't hear anything. At first, I thought it was just my phone, but the same thing happened on my sister’s phone too"
A Google user,4,American translation not British. Sometimes really annoying. Wish there was a proper English version for the UK. Otherwise very good.
A Google user,5,"Love it, veryy useful and simple👍"
A Google user,3,There is not english language option that's why i deleted this app otherwise it is nice
A Google user,5,very very important app
A Google user,5,good app i like it ❤️
A Google user,5,Duolingo is the best for you and your language 🌎 just by listening and doing it they have a YouTube channel to so please
A Google user,5,I have learned so much in the past few days. I recommend Duo
A Google user,5,The best app to learn everything
A Google user,1,add thai language
A Google user,5,best app for English learning and speaking
A Google user,3,"Overall solid learning. However, the practice sentences are FAR too repetitive. There's only so many times you can practice the EXACT the sentence. The app does a good job of incorporating prev. vocab into new lessons. However forced flash card review is too frequent without a way to skip over known words. The free version would be amazing IF it wasn't so clogged with ads. The basic subacription primarily just eliminates ads. The premium sub's AI features are great but the monthly fee is INSANE."
A Google user,5,"Muy buena app, sirve mucho para no perder práctica y aprender nuevas palabras en un idioma en mi caso ingles, si quieres aprender un idioma al 100 tienes que combinar esta app con otros métodos pero igual me a servido mucho para aprender inglés, es muy útil 5 estrellas sin duda."
A Google user,5,I love this app I can learn easily English to speak read
A Google user,5,I have used this app for many years My girlfriend is also using your app learning (American) English I am surprised you haven't got around teaching UK English there are many differences.
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,5,great!

A Google user,5,"This app is so good and i wanted to learn english faster therefore i install this app to learn english but there is not only english to learn there is so many language to learn and i want to give 5/5***** and you don't even feel that you are studying because its feel like game, so i want to say if you want to learn any types of language then download this app😊"
A Google user,5,Best app

A Google user,5,Make languages easy to learn
A Google user,1,"The app says there is music and math, but when I install it, there is no music and math, this means, this app does not update at all"
A Google user,5,very nice and good aap
A Google user,3,good app
A Google user,2,"The app is good at encouraging continual use and repetition in order to learn a language. However, it teaches very little grammar and focuses heavily on learning a language by ""sight-words."" This prohibits further understanding and discourages circumlocution to try and say what you want. Yes, it won't be proper grammar, but the person you are talking to will understand."
A Google user,5,Very easy and fun in learning
A Google user,5,"hallo, ist bin jerett, I Love this"
A Google user,5,"Fun and easy way to learn a new language, I recommend 100."

A Google user,4,great app for learning .. but at times gets too competitive and the app bugs get to your nerves.
A Google user,5,Duolingo is to good application its helps to me lean different languages
A Google user,2,"The app used to let you discuss or find explanations for language rules by leaving or reading comments in a discussion board. However, a while back they got rid of it. Now when you don't understand something, you have to pay to have it explained."
A Google user,5,Nice duolingo aap is very interested
A Google user,4,very good
A Google user,1,I give this rating because who is going to learn Spanish when the sentence doesn't make any sense. Example : The cow opened a chocolate box and many more of these absurd sentences.

A Google user,3,"My duolingo doesn't have audio. At first, it worked well with audio and all. Now, there's something wrong with the audio because, no matter the language, there's no sound, and it's a pretty huge problem when you are learning a new language."
A Google user,5,It help me a lot with Japanese
A Google user,5,very nice app
A Google user,4,A good app but sometimes prone to glitches such as you doing an exercise and not getting your points.
A Google user,1,good
A Google user,1,"Enjoyable to learn both listening, writing & speaking. Very POOR support. Virtually nothing in the app or online site. I have had no capability to follow someone or have them follow me. Sorry But I'm not paying $12.99 a month for half working app"
A Google user,3,"in the effort to force you to subscribe and pay, the new way you can't earn hearts to continue is really demotivating to learning."
A Google user,5,nice app for school I like it
A Google user,5,it really is fun and also helpful download it so you can understand more languages!

A Google user,5,Duolingo took my wife and kids...I don't have long left before it's me next.
A Google user,5,Duolingo is excellent for learning a language at your own pace. It uses different types of exercises to make the lessons interesting and fun. Frequent repetition helps increase vocabulary and embeds the grammar rules in the learner's memory. Currently I'm simultaneously learning two languages using Duolingo.
A Google user,5,Gud
A Google user,5,Fun and surprisingly effective way to learn a language.
A Google user,1,I'm giving 1 star for not being able to see my podiums

A Google user,1,"Please fix your ads. Your ads are disgusting. Take into account who sponsors you. I like your language learning features, and at the moment I can't afford pro, but I might just stop using Duolingo altogether if this isn't fixed. I don't want mature ads. I don't need or want those things in my mind. Thank you. Please fix it, and I will be inclined to increase my rating again, since this is my only but biggest concern."
A Google user,5,this app is really good it teaches you step by step
A Google user,5,fantastic 😊
A Google user,1,"Enjoyable and teaches you basically everything you could learn before actually speaking with the native people. However, the heart system sucks so bad. They recently made the ""practice to earn hearts"" function premium only. This is absolute garbage and should still be available to unpaid users! Or maybe set the hearts to refill faster? Either way this limitation is ridiculous. Also faar too many ads, I watch 2 ads per lesson, I spend more time viewing ads than actually learning..."
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,4,"Too many ads, some of which you can't get out of without shutting off the program. Quite often they use new words or give you sentences with no translation so you don't know what happened. They should have a channel that builds vocabulary without more and more confusing tenses"
A Google user,4,"Great/fun app. My only issue is they combine super/max users with non-paid subscription users on the Leaderboard, so the paid subscribers have an unfair advantage. If you are motivated by competition, it can be frustrating. I am sure this is a tactic to promote their subscription service, but my daughter lost interest in the app as the weeks went by."
A Google user,5,very good learning aap I love it ♥️🤓
A Google user,4,Bahut achha app hai 👌 💫
A Google user,5,this is a really good app I learned alot on my trips to France and Canada duolingo really helps and is really simple and makes learning a new language really fun!
A Google user,1,"Tbh massive money grab, limits learning experience with hearts and doesn't even explain why you were wrong unless you pay a monthly fee. You're better off wasting away in school for this than using this app."
A Google user,5,Fun learning
A Google user,4,"excelente app para aprender el idioma que quieras,es interactiva y lo mejor de todo, es gratis"
A Google user,3,"1. Kids lose focus every now and then and are eager to just keep adding new courses rather than focusing on the current one. Duolingo needs parental control features where we can hide/disable the add course button. 2. There should be feature to restart a unit for revision. 3. The Japanese lessons are full of mistakes especially with ichi, ni, san. 4. Lessons are either too repetitive or too full of new words, there needs to a balance."
A Google user,4,very good aap learn to English
A Google user,4,this application is very helpful but it needs more development in graphics
A Google user,5,so good 😊
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,5,Duo be mine for valentine
A Google user,5,good 👍
A Google user,1,Duolingo literally uses their gems for inflation even tho its hard everything is pro and max and you have to wait for hours to get a heart and and there is no points for hearts if your learning so much ads even duolingo's ads itself comes built in with it for some reason and if your on your last report you can't even report the question if it has a bug and the new update makes it to get one heart and you can't get more and you have to wait for an hr ppl are trying to learn Trash app don't get it
A Google user,4,Very Useful Application for improve English language with Enjoy..
A Google user,5,"Why after you finish a lesson you have to watch a ad is just not fun. Out of all of that is just good so I rate it 4stars, ok, the ""wake up duo with a lesson!"" Is just too funny and why? That's rude"
A Google user,5,great
A Google user,5,must app hai
A Google user,5,intresting and joyful to learn...it Actually supports for learning other languages. ☺️
A Google user,5,It's a fabulous way to learn! The exercises are created in a conversational style so it's not imposing grammatical rules and verb conjunction like other language schools do.
A Google user,4,best app for learning english
A Google user,5,bien
A Google user,4,"Really enjoying duolingo and I think it's actually improving my grasp on Spanish. I've heard that folks often use Duolingo in conjunction with another learning tool, but so far I'm just using it on its own. The competitive aspect definitely motivates me to keep up. (I have the paid version.) Update 2/2025: have had some issues with not receiving the correct amount of XP even when in ""triple xp"" mode, or even ""double xp"" mode. I restart the app but it doesn't always fix the problem."
A Google user,5,super 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Duolingo👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
A Google user,5,good 😊
A Google user,5,this is the very helpful aap for learning and speaking english.so I am happy from this app😊
A Google user,5,best app
A Google user,5,"Duo makes it fun to learn! Also, I like that we start out learning helpful words and phrases right away."
A Google user,5,great for learning the fundamentals
A Google user,5,I really like duo and it fun learning new languages
A Google user,3,"It's awesome, but now you can't gain more hearts when they run out. They should had left up that option."
A Google user,5,i love it 😻😻😻😻😻😻
A Google user,5,"I have a 622 day streak, Duo has helped me a lot in learning Spanish. It's easy once you actually try, and I don't even have Super Duolingo or Max!"
A Google user,3,Having an issue with the scoring. Just keeps going three dots without any scores???????? Please fix it.
A Google user,5,I've enjoyed the challenge of learning Italian.
A Google user,5,good if you want go somewhere else
A Google user,5,Very fun way to learn a language. Got addicted and do many lessons a day. Highly recommend
A Google user,5,it really can help you learn the language
A Google user,4,"Fun app with a good selection of languages. would be nice if more were added like some of the African languages or the 7 different chinese dialect groups (mandarin/cantonese etc...) and Thai, as well as Icelandic, to complete the Nordic language group."
A Google user,1,"I hate it , it says I'm incorrect when i am correct and makes me do a quiz !🤨"
A Google user,5,"Duolingo always wait me to comeback, thankyou"
A Google user,5,🥰🥰🥰
A Google user,5,Very good app💗
A Google user,1,I hate Duoling
A Google user,5,feels like a gatcha game without the gatcha
A Google user,5,amazing.
A Google user,5,good for Filipinos
A Google user,5,Excelente app para aprender inglés
A Google user,5,Great for learning!
A Google user,5,"Sweet app, owls are great ways to keep learning new skills."
A Google user,5,I've used Duolingo off and on for a couple years now. and I have to say they've got it figured out! (I'm learning Spanish) the conversations that you can listen to and then it will ask you in English what they were talking about to make sure you are connecting and comprehending is AWESOME! I don't normally post app reviews but that aspect alone blew my mind!
A Google user,5,Very good for learning languages and math! 5 stars for service.
A Google user,5,great
A Google user,2,"There's to many ads, I didn't mind when it was just duolingo, but now the ads are brain rot. Duolingo has slowly been downgrading. Please get rid of the ads you baddie 🙏🏽"
A Google user,5,Good for learning new a skill
A Google user,5,This app is so good!
A Google user,5,weldone
A Google user,1,It's scary I never did my Spanish lesson Help???
A Google user,5,It's easy for learning about fun 😊
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,2,Chinese course doesn't recognize any of my pronunciation
A Google user,5,it is best to learning language to go to travel
A Google user,5,thanks so much
A Google user,5,Favorite language learning app I always recommend to others!
A Google user,4,He took my family when I didn't do the lessons 😭😭😭😭
A Google user,5,good use
A Google user,5,Congratulations
A Google user,4,this is a greet app for learning languages
A Google user,5,Got better at math!!
A Google user,5,Application good
A Google user,5,Nice 👍
A Google user,5,This app is Perfect for beginners!
A Google user,5,First I have to say that this app helps you learn a different language by a lot also keep up on your streak because he will blow up your phone with notifications you should also get the widget because the pictures Duolingo put on it is funny. Anyway get the app and follow Duolingo on TikTok (If you didn't delete it)
A Google user,3,"The app works well. I've learned a good bit of German using the app, and it has good features for the pro version. The basic version is too limited to really get much out of it, and it's a shame that it's cut so short just to upsell the premium version. The ranking and competition system is kind of gimmicky, and the topmost ranks are just bot accounts anyway. My biggest hangup is all of the random sentences and mentions of gay/LGBT type content. Kids don't need to see that when using Duolingo."
A Google user,5,Good
A Google user,4,"very good, but has ads unless you pay"
A Google user,5,"Great way to learn language, 5 out of 5!"
A Google user,5,This is very helpful if you want to learn any language. And I have been using Duolingo for 21 days
A Google user,5,it is very very good for learning I like it very much if you want to go somewhere and don't know language so this is best and guiders are also pretty good
A Google user,5,it's such a good app
A Google user,3,I'm so disgusted with the changes which have resulted in my spending far less time learning each day. I don't do Lengendarys anymore because I'm too fearful of losing hearts now that I can't recapture them by doing review lessons - which also reinforces comprehension. I feel like Duolingo has become a money grab and I am no longer benefitting from this app as I have over the last few years. Looking at other options.
A Google user,5,Awesome 😎
A Google user,4,"Me gustaría que tenga una opción para repasar las palabras que ya se de forma offline aunque no sume experiencia. Y otra cosa, estaría bueno que se puedan saltar todos los ejercicios de escuchar y de hablar (los cuentos por ejemplo) para las personas que son sordas, de esa forma podrían ser más incisivos."
A Google user,5,this is soooooooooooo funny I learn a lot of Spanish
A Google user,2,ok
A Google user,1,Endless technical problems and NO technical support!!!
A Google user,5,great
A Google user,5,it's helped me so much with my journey of learning korean!! 안녕하세요 어떻게 지내세요
A Google user,2,"Very few countries are given to Bangladeshis, it is very sad"
A Google user,5,because i can learn every language like korea thank you doulingo
A Google user,2,super
A Google user,4,sometimes answers aren't right and I wish it would give me a breakdown of tenses so I could see the patterns
A Google user,2,"I really enjoyed this app and upgraded to the yearly subscription but up until recently, my account lost all my progress from all my languages and I was logged into some random persons account with a different name, email, etc. and when I try to log back into my account, they said my account can't be found...."
A Google user,5,really good I appreciate for it
A Google user,5,it's sooooooooooooooooo good
A Google user,5,"You guys help me learn so much, thank you!"
A Google user,5,it's amazing app really 👌🏻💚
A Google user,5,Yep this is better then any learning app I love how being friends with people it's very fun!!!
A Google user,5,"The app is really good for learning languages, I've mastered basic German quite easily by learning in this app. My only complaint is there's too few languages for learning. I hope the development team adds more languages for us to learn."
A Google user,5,I LOVE IT THANKS FOR TEACHING ME INTERMEDIATE ENGLISH🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️
A Google user,4,It's good but cannot learn more things in same time.
A Google user,5,help me learn new languages in an allergy and I have to do my Duolingo so I really like Duolingo
A Google user,3,"Update 9Feb25: App keeps getting ""stuck"" when accounting for completed lessons. I've done 8 already and it keeps saying I've only completed 3. This has been going on for at least a month. Super annoying. ----------------------------------- 3Feb23 Love it. Easy to use. Listening and speaking exercises are great."
A Google user,4,thanks very useful my life for english
A Google user,5,the best
A Google user,5,It's Good and Nice
A Google user,5,like it
A Google user,5,very useful app learning to all languages
A Google user,5,So fun this app is like a teacher learning other languages and I'll give this a 5 stars duo cute
A Google user,5,brilliant
A Google user,5,This is a very good app use it i am learning a lot of new things from this every day! Ty Duolingo
A Google user,5,perfect app for learning new languages 🤍
A Google user,4,"I'm getting ther,"
A Google user,5,ti amo duolingo gracias por enseñarme.
A Google user,4,"In the past week, I can't access the leader board, or either of the alternating games hosted there. Please fix it."
A Google user,5,Very fun learning game
A Google user,5,because I learned any word
A Google user,5,Love it!
A Google user,2,"Provides no instruction on pronunciation or how to handle gendered languages (such as french). It expects you to repeat phrases with no prior practice. It expects you to know you need to use ""une"" instead of ""un"" when referring to a woman with no explanation as to why or what was wrong with your answer. I gave up on using this app to learn French because it doesn't seem geared towards learning a language, just quizzing you on things you already know about a language."
A Google user,5,helping me learn German fast and easy
A Google user,4,is a very good learning game.👌🥰
A Google user,5,this game is amazing. I love learning korean
A Google user,5,fun learning japanese with Duolingo
A Google user,5,"100% works,I recommend people to try it."
A Google user,4,the biggest downside is learning alot about American cities. I live in Canada and will probably never say the name of these cities outside this app. I'd rather learn many random cities then just American cities. BTW not an issue in learning French as much as it is in learning Korea otherwise duolingo makes learning fun and easy.
A Google user,5,Good it awsome to learn all languages gracias duo
A Google user,5,Fun way to learn espanol!
A Google user,5,love. it's interactive and fun
A Google user,4,with Duolingo is pretty good but pretty bad like a little bit at the same time
A Google user,4,it's a fun app. I've really learnt a lot of Japanese using this app.
A Google user,5,learning another language is not usually fun for most people but somehow this makes it pretty fun. My wife and I compete against each other and even bought the upgraded version to get rid of the ads because with the ads it was practically unbearable
A Google user,5,love this so much
A Google user,4,super 👍
A Google user,5,"I'm old enough to remember back when Duolingo was truly free, without any catches or paid features. But it's still excellent as a free app. Thank you 🙏🏿"
A Google user,3,I am getting stuck repeating the same lesson over and over cuz the 3rd drop box in verb conjugations disappears and doesn't allow me to fill in the other sections. The screen locks up and doesn't let me go forward or back it ONLY let's you Quit! which makes you loose all your progress...this happened so much I wanted to rage quit :(
A Google user,1,AI driven garbage
A Google user,5,It's a five star for me I'm beginning to pick up real good on Spanish and I'm learning it for free Sounds too good to be true But guess what it's true 😂 I advise you download it
A Google user,5,I learn so much
A Google user,2,"Fun, but glitchy and inaccurate. The listening feature is very spotty and sometimes doesn't hear you or register at all, causing you to error on the exercise and ruin any chances at a perfect lesson. Sometimes restarting the app fixes it. Once that feature is improved on, I'd have nothing to complain about. :)"
A Google user,5,it good and great I almost better a russian
A Google user,5,I complained that my app still seems offline and nothing has been done about it 😔😕 Kindly check that for me
A Google user,5,This app is the best way for learning new languages
A Google user,2,Know what really takes the wind out of your sails when trying to learn a new language? 2 minute ads after one lesson.
A Google user,1,"It is no longer possible to fill up hearts with practice. Only when out of hearts it is possible to do one practice. That is soooo anoying. Also bugs dont get fixed and new ones apear frequently. Very bad experience, this app is sadly declining a lot."
A Google user,5,wunderbar
A Google user,5,Helps me to improve my spainish skills!!
A Google user,5,thebest program
A Google user,1,"Duolingo needs a 1 cause they deleted my 72 streak and I don't have a lot of gems to get it back. And I am tired of getting so many ads and I need to pay so much gems just to repair my stupid streak like 700 or 2000 is way to much gems and now I cannot get my streak back. AND I CAN'T UNINSTALL THE GAME!! ALSO I HAD 1003 GEMS AND THEN I ACCIDENTALLY CLICKED MORE HEARTS AND NOW I HAVE 658 GEMS!!! DUOLING SHOULD HAVE A ""are you sure?"" BUTTON SO PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ME DON'T GIVE A BAD REVIEW!!"
A Google user,5,"very fun to learn languages with duoling,Don't skip your duolingo tho..."
A Google user,5,this is the best app for learning languages it very flexible and easy to understand
A Google user,5,really perfect application for learning I am learning a hard really language but doulingo made me really know them and learn them well!! thank you so much doulingo
A Google user,5,I like the style of learning and you can dedicate just a few minutes at a time.
A Google user,5,awesome arrangement of activities.
A Google user,5,very nice
A Google user,5,تحفهه بجدد
A Google user,5,I learned a lot. Aprendí mucho.
A Google user,5,Do I have to explain? The app is just amazing!! ✨✨💚💚
A Google user,3,Great app HOWEVER are the leagues necessary! I love this app and think it has been fantastic in teaching so many people other there who want to learn new language in a fun interactive way BUT does it really have to be based on leagues. As a full time working mom of 5 kids as you can imagine I'm juggling a huge amount of tasks and duolingo is my downtime but I find the leagues disappointing as they add pressure that I do not need added to my life when I just want to have fun and learn.
A Google user,5,بجد بجد برنامج هائل جدآ و ساعدني كتير جدآ في شغلي
A Google user,4,"Very good and useful app. Some more variety in words and numbers, plus more practical phrases would improve this."
A Google user,5,it's a great app! makes learning a new language super fun!
A Google user,5,"So far so good, Duolingo is turning out to be one of the best free/paid apps on playstore. wondering how come it took me so long to try out Duolingo for learning a new language. love the well broken down bytesized lessons for every level of expertise. To the Dev team.....keep it going👌🏽"
A Google user,5,a great tool to broaden your horizons. surprisingly effective for how easy to use it is. I wish I had used it sooner
A Google user,1,The advertising takes up 50% of the time.
A Google user,5,"Love this app, been using it for over 3y now, it's cool to keep a language in mind everyday, but please please please hear me out, add croatian to this app, I love this language but I'm stuck with almost no app who's doing croatian, and switching on two different types of app is not interesting.. Please Duolingo team add croatian!!!"
A Google user,3,doesn't have Mongolian
A Google user,4,"Give XP boost sometimes, but they don't really have varied answers good app tho"
A Google user,5,very easy to navigate and learn from. I'm enjoying the Chinese language
A Google user,4,Fun and easy to learn languages 😁
A Google user,5,"A great app with choice of languages ta choose. Brilliant! Yet somehow insisting ""App not connected to Google Play"". Wonder what is going on?"
A Google user,2,"You show words before you tell they mean. You use unnecessary places like London or Philadelphia - it would be better to use Venice or Florence in your examples. You give the ""option"" of buying extra minutes or levels - and if you refuse to buy them, you shut down. It could be a whole lot better."
A Google user,1,"Instead of a language learning aide, duolingo has turned into a toy app with insiduous monetization tactics. Not recommendable at all anymore."
A Google user,5,diese App ist perfect 🤩🤩👌
A Google user,1,poop 💩
A Google user,5,the best I like it
A Google user,5,it helps me learn my favorite language and I all ready know a lot like une graçon et une chat(a boy and a cat)
A Google user,5,You're making it so simple than I thought
A Google user,5,I like that I can spend just a few minutes per day studying Spanish and make good progress.
A Google user,5,niice
A Google user,5,very gud
A Google user,1,"used free trial of super duolingo, and even though I shouldn't be penalised for not continuing with it after the free trial as advised, I can't refill my hearts with a practice run. Shame on you for lying."
A Google user,2,"The frequent problem of the app getting stuck on a black screen when going to an ad is annoying! There is no way to go back, I have to end the app or restart my phone. Additionally, the scoreboard has issues not loading frequently. It would be better if it weren't so buggy!"
A Google user,5,so entertaining
A Google user,5,Great Apk
A Google user,5,"Doulingo is a very learning app, when I started it was quite boring so I tried other apps and guess what I came back to doulingo cuz I didn't really enjoy it. So I suggest who so ever reading this to download doulingo cuz it's the best app you'll experience."
A Google user,2,never get extra points when it says I've got double and triple points just single points
A Google user,5,relly good for learning all ages
A Google user,3,Gracia amigos. However that audios are not properly functioning.
A Google user,4,it is really amazing and really good for fast learning
A Google user,4,This app is great!
A Google user,1,Continually marking answers wrong when they are gramatically correct. Words are misspelled. Ads all the time. 5hrs to replenish one heart?! This app has turned into cash grab.
A Google user,5,تطبيق جميل ويستطيع ان يأسسك بنسبة كبيرة
A Google user,5,very interesting to learn here. I encourage others to do same
A Google user,3,"An expensive way to learn if you pay monthly, have to be very serious to pay, but it's fun but doesn't actually teach a lot. It does not help you much with vocabulary and learning the verbs. (Repetitive words) Unfortunately too, it is made in United States so everything is Americanised. Pants (trousers)"
A Google user,5,It provides as many options as possible for languages and mistakes. It also makes you feel eager and motivates you.
A Google user,2,"Don't waste your money on Duolingo Max, the AI video call is rubbish and it's the same conversation every time. It's glitchy and sometimes have to try 3 times to get it working. If you try to ask ""Lili"" any questions or have a different conversation it doesn’t work. It's no good for learning a language to travel. I'm racing through the lessons and we have only just learnt numbers up to 10? and very few useful phrases that you would actually need travelling."
A Google user,5,"Like a fun game you play every day after work, except you're literally becoming bilingual in the process 😂"
A Google user,5,Good learning game I'm really learning French
A Google user,5,"I love Doulingo 💜 💜💜 I get to learn languages like Japanese, Dutch, Hawaiian, Swahili! I also do the music and math and it's sooo fun!"
A Google user,5,I'm learning so much! I'm excited to speak Spanish with someone.
A Google user,5,Good

A Google user,5,it help me learn a lot
A Google user,5,its a really especial app with a lot abilities.
A Google user,1,"The more I use this app, the more I am frustrated. It hangs, shows black area instead of an image, it sometimes awfully slow, it presses too much for getting XP, it is not smart enough in many ways: the word hints often irrelevant, it doesn't recognize many types of typos, it doesn't consider that many users are not native English speakers. Etc, etc. It regularly steals XPs that I earn with blood, sweet, and tiers😬"
A Google user,5,it nice and easy to learn
A Google user,5,I love Duolingo because there're a lot of languages that we can learn and I well like to learn France and it really helps me🦉💚💌
A Google user,5,The most fun and educational game at the same time. It teaches you every day how to speak English skillfully and fluently and nourishes your vocabulary through fun.
A Google user,4,"bisakah kalian membuat opsi absen belajar sementara? aku sedang sakit, tapi aku juga harus menjaga runtunan belajar bahasa inggrisku, melihat ponsel membuat kepalaku semakin sakit"
A Google user,5,very interesting
A Google user,1,Used to be a fun way to learn foreign languages. Now they sell so much stuff it feels like I'm at a timeshare pitch. Probably moving on when current subscription is up.
A Google user,5,I really like it because it make me more learn English
A Google user,5,I love this app it helps me learn a lot of words phrases and more

A Google user,4,Great app that'd very useful. However the animations are excessive and the regular vibrations infuriating.
A Google user,1,"This app used to be good, but has been absolutely ruined by the recent change that stops you practicing to regain hearts. I didn’t mind watching a few adds to use it, but no way am I subscribing to get unlimited hearts so after 565 days and stuck on one exercise for 5 days, I'm done with it."
A Google user,5,it is so cute I want to play it every day

A Google user,1,"it really punishes you for not paying for a subscription. you get 5 ""lifes"" and for I to replenish it takes 1 hour for each ""life"". if you do nothing all day that's not a huge deal but people who have busy days and only have so much free time it really screws you over."
A Google user,5,it's very good app
A Google user,5,this is super nice and good because it's helping me learn languages and it has streaks on how many days have you been learning so I love it and it's super helpful.
A Google user,4,so far Duolingo app is enticing since it gives all the rooted words of any language one would like to know. I love it ❣️❣️
A Google user,5,it's either Spanish or vanish

A Google user,5,"I like the app, I own the yearly subscription, and make my relatives learn the languages hustle free."
A Google user,5,"Very simple and helpful tool. incorporates reading, speaking and writing. Great app."
A Google user,4,"Very great app! You can do any language + music and math if you want! The downfall is if you run out of hearts you have to wait 5 hours, but still a great app!"
A Google user,2,"This is a great app yet after recent update, it's impossible to track the list of other users on this app. Please fix it asap. Thank you"
A Google user,5,"I give it 5 stars because it has been teaching me the Language I want to learn other apps didn't do that. it dose ask you Questions, but it's really nothing personal.

A Google user,2,"It's a fun and interactive way to learn Spanish and German. I had given DUOLINGO more stars previously. However, there is no assistance on Duolingo Max when learning Polish. Needing an extra explanation for Polish was the reason that I purchased Max, since Polish is a different language to learn. This is where assistance is needed. More support results in more stars"

A Google user,5,"The best app for learning a language and I love the teaching style, and how it gets you to practice your weak areas and mistakes. My only criticism is there is no left orientated side combed hair on the avatar creator so my hair is combed the wrong way on my avatar."
A Google user,5,"From my perspective, Duolingo stands out as an exceptionally effective and highly practical application for language learning, offering a comprehensive and well-rounded approach to acquiring new languages. What makes Duolingo particularly remarkable is its user-friendly design, which caters to a broad spectrum of learners, ranging from complete beginners to those seeking to refine their skills in a language they are already familiar with.

A Google user,5,"I think this app is very well structured, as well as the lessons and the pace at which they allow me to learn. I also enjoy the encouragement that it provides and the opportunity to correct those mistakes with a reward for doing so. By being able to correct them, I am able to learn more easily from those mistakes so as to not repeat them again. I recommend this app to anyone who desires to learn another language no matter their reasons or intentions."

A Google user,2,"The new ""awards"" are a serious let down 😞 !!! 1) I was looking forward to finishing the old ones and I hate having to start over. But much more importantly 2) You get almost no feedback to tell you how you are doing. For example I have no idea how close I am to the next ""Mistake Mechanic"" level! There really needs to be a counter on the badge so you can tell! Please fix this!"
A Google user,4,good
A Google user,5,I'm learning japanese
A Google user,4,"I love doulingo and have been using it for years, but just recently it deleted my friend streak and unfollow my sister for no such reason, we both found it extremely weird so if they could fix it that would be awesome."

A Google user,5,this app is very good
A Google user,4,"It's a great app, especially for beginners who want to learn a new language. I've been waiting for an advanced level (130 -160) to be opened. Unless, I've no choice in doing repeated exercises which is kind of boring.🙄 I want to improve my English, and I'm interested in teaching Farsi for other speakers."

A Google user,5,"Loving the app so far, great user and experience and interface. Great work devs..🤝."
A Google user,5,i would love if Duolingo had basque but the actual learning is great.
A Google user,2,"It's more of a game than a language learning app. There is a lot of potential with Duolingo, but the flaws and gameifacation ruins it. I'm on the Japanese course, and it's not been a good experience. Most of the speakers talk too fast, even with the slowed down option. Also, when you are asked to repeat things (which doesn't start until too far in, imo) you are not given enough time to read and speak. It will cut you off and mark you wrong. Migaku and Renshuu beats the pants off of Duolingo."
A Google user,5,SO Amazing
A Google user,2,Heart system is so dumb
A Google user,5,great for beginners
A Google user,5,Very good app thanks to had maden this helped me in learning Japanese language

A Google user,2,"Great app for learning vocab. Useless for learning grammar. It could easily be improved by putting more information in words hints (gender, declension, etc) The 'guides' to each section are completely useless. More effort seems to be put into sounds and animations than improving the language courses."

A Google user,1,"I complete their Romanian course 18 months ago, and just returned to brush up, but unfortunately the app is no longer useable after being spoiled with constant, lengthy ads. Unless you have the time and patience waiting for ads to finish inbetween every exercise, you're not going to get far any more, unfortunately. Used to be great, now they just want to force you to pay for a subscription."

A Google user,3,"It's because if you don't have subscription you get only 4 chances to do wrong if you do more mistakes you can't learn the language and also if you don't have subscription you can only learn the language content can't do it for more time, can't do much mistakes and also there are many other things in the one with subscription... So just give us unlimited hearts we want nothing more please Duolingo please.__ Just scroll the reviews down and you will know that some have given only 1 star."

This all happens the last day of tournament finale. Fix it, fast."

A Google user,2,"Since the hearts system came in, it seems ridiculous to cut someone's learning so short over a single letter mistake. Usually a great app, completely ruined by not allowing someone to progress. Almost seems like they should remove the 'free' version and just force the paid one now."
A Google user,5,great

A Google user,1,Not getting double xp after completing a lesson and it's hard to stay in diamond league when others gets the double xp and moving forward.
A Google user,2,I have been using this app for several years and have enjoyed it... however... recently the ads have been getting way more frequent and the ads are mostly scams that are hard to close and rely on you accidentally clicking on the wrong spot. Shame on you duo. You used to be cool but greed has gotten the best of you.

A Google user,5,I absolutely love this app!!
A Google user,3,There are many times when the English sentence does not match the Indonesian or Italian sentence. I keep having to hit the flag button and submitting the error. It would also help if the course would explain why sentences are the way they are. Right now I am having to figure out everything on my own. If Duolingo is not going to explain why then I might as well just use Google Translate.
A Google user,2,"Hello everyone this app is best for learning English and I have this AP from 8 days. It has not been much day since I started learning English but I have learned a lot of English, that is why I have completed it in just 1 day. I have given my best performance. Let's see further whether my English improves or not. I am confident that it will improve. I know English 40%."

A Google user,3,"I like that whatever language you're learning the app teaches it to in different ways , e.g. , the way you're being taught Arabic would be alot different to the way you're taught Italian. I do have just one complaint, why has earning free lives been taken away, don't you want people to spend more time learning , they can't do that if you're limiting the amount of lives they get and on top of that you're not even refilling them fast enough . This ruins the app experience."

A Google user,3,"The structure of the lessons is helpful and fun, and the interface is easy to use. They lose two stars for aggressive money grubbing; I remember a time before they interrupted every lesson with ads, and it was a better product. Presumably they were still making money back then, so I can only assume someone wanted more short-term gains at the cost of product quality. This issue is fixable and will earn my 5 star rating."

A Google user,1,"Would you rather spend more time watching ads than learning a language? You will love this app! 6 month later edit: I thought it might be worth trying again. Then two ads followed by ads for the family plan later, un-installed again."

A Google user,5,👍
A Google user,4,ok
A Google user,5,Useful
A Google user,3,"Good app, but the streak system very tedious. It puts you in a mindset that makes you have a new fear and chore to do your duolingo lesson or lose your steak. Maybe they could make it progress based and not doing a lesson EVERY day which like I stated it's very tedious.And the avcivites you do are kinda boring after a will. I wish it was more interactive or more fun. They should do more than translating. This app is good if you are taking lesson from a native speaker and duolingo is extra help."
A Google user,5,Best of learning English Apps
A Google user,5,I love it very much! it helps me learn any language I want! 😊👍
A Google user,5,I really love it
A Google user,4,A great app and productivity tool for practicing a second language everyday. I took one star because even when you have one paid tier there are a lot of ads for upgrading which gets kind of annoying.
A Google user,5,lern da language make!!!
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,1,Can No Longer Practice for Hearts. Instead they want you to pay for them. What a pathetic money grab.....
A Google user,2,"Easy to learn. Love that you hear, read and speak !!! Unfortunately the customer service is bad. There are problems with getting the promised points when doing exercises. Contacted customer service many times, informing them about a problem but the only confirm getting the report but not doing anything about ir. Problem is now for over 2 month and nothing happens. Not an individuell answer to the problem, not fixing it at all. This shows how much they care about there customers. Bad attitude!!!"
A Google user,5,we can learn other languages
A Google user,5,it is very good to learn other languages from Duolingo😁
A Google user,3,"My app is broken. It's not letting me unfollow someone and the feed in general just doesn't work properly. Also, I've been using Duolingo for years but it didn't help me actually learn to converse in French on my last couple of trips. This app will help you learn to read another language but actually getting conversent is a different part of the brain. I would upgrade to Max but it's just too expensive."
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,5,nice 👍
A Google user,5,good👍
A Google user,1,Mind blowing

A Google user,5,it's the best learning language app
A Google user,1,Bro never ever buy subscription on this app they even not rfund it 🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡
A Google user,2,"I LOVE the lessons, but HATE the guilt trips! I work a lot and can only use the app when I have extra time. It's constantly acting like a neglected love interest! Makes me less motivated to open it or learn. It's annoying."
A Google user,5,great app
A Google user,1,"UPDATE - 2/8/2025 - Now it's not awarding double points when it's supposed to be. This has happened twice today, so annoying! ******************** Not happy that you can no longer replenish back up to 5 hearts-that really SUCKS! I like the app mostly, but it does count a lot of correct answers as incorrect frequently. It really pisses me off when it exhausts all of my hearts for correct answers, and I have to start a lesson over. Also, the hints are almost always wrong! Do better, Duolingo!"
A Google user,5,It's very amazing.
A Google user,5,thank you Duolingo.
A Google user,4,"A really clean interface, funny engagement tactics, feels more like a game than a learning tool. very pricey 🫰😔"
A Google user,1,I feel pissed off when I report the same mistake over and over again boy nobody cares.
A Google user,3,need more levels in Finnish
A Google user,4,But this take too much time for downloading
A Google user,5,awesome!
A Google user,5,u get yo learn alot
A Google user,1,"Used to be the best app, simple and efficient. Now it is too complicated with NO OPTIONS for us to adjust the course (e.g I don't want to practice writing. Why forcing me to so that??). Also how on earth you teach beginners names of food before you teach them basic words like Hello, How Are You, Bye etc.."
A Google user,4,very good app I use Duolingo daily.
A Google user,5,good app
A Google user,5,"SOO GOOD! all the languages you can learn, and if you wanna be like your family, this will help! Love it!"
A Google user,5,"An exceptional app to learn Mandarin, because it is more effective if we learn to write the characters. I learned faster by writing the characters onto a notebook or pieces of paper. I want to learn Hindi but have no intention to learn & write Hindi characters. Is there any option in Duolingo to allow this?"
A Google user,4,best app is for learning. its best feature is it nudge we for learning.
A Google user,5,super best app in yt kailash gameing guru rating
A Google user,5,Duo is very useful to me for learning Spanish language. Gracias Duo

A Google user,4,I've been learning Japanese with my friends and Duolingo has made it fun for me and interesting.It is an awesome app that makes me laugh and learn with my own effort.
A Google user,5,This app is great and helps a lot in learning new languages
A Google user,5,I LOVE THIS APP I HAVE 2 STREAKKKKK
A Google user,5,it's fun and very functional!!! love it!!!
A Google user,5,Just the best learning app for beginners looking to learn a new language from scratch. I'd highly recommend it. It's like your own pocket teacher!
A Google user,5,great free learning platform that motivates you to stay on track with daily practice.
A Google user,4,It's great at helping at learning a language but sometimes I get a question that is at a way higher level than what I'm currently learning.
A Google user,5,the app is good
A Google user,5,Great so far after 30 straight days! Feel like I'm well on my way to being able to speak German confidently for my trip in five months.
A Google user,5,"fun, easy, pleasant and efficient since it makes us realize our mistakes,and tests us,again on them, so it is personalized"
A Google user,2,"2 years I'm using the app and it's worst every year. I would suggest to try other app before subscribe to this one. I reported also several times to customer support about bugs in the way the scores are calculated but no one came back to me and also it's a pity to have french and dutch in the app but to don't let french speaker learns dutch, especially for Belgian people."
A Google user,1,"I had originally given Duolingo a high review, but it has degraded so much from the point it was at a few years ago. The app is an endless ad circuit now and has no real functionality for free users. It is too heavily reliant on AI and pushes their premium products endlessly. You used to be able to practice to earn more hearts, now you must pay money. The language learning element is gone, this app is dying. Stay away."
A Google user,5,It is fanTASTIC💜
A Google user,5,so much love this app
A Google user,5,"Fantastic learning tool, loving it so far."
A Google user,5,a great way to learn and connect with distant family members
A Google user,2,it made me feel bad and scared
A Google user,5,"good service!, matututo ka talaga!"
A Google user,5,i give 5 Star this because I learned many languages
A Google user,5,It's a slay app!!!😀🙂🫠😉😊😚
A Google user,5,I love this app but why are all the end of lesson graphics suddenly ugly or unpleasant? Please bring back the older ones
A Google user,5,"Awesome 🤗 tengo 840 días con dúo, español, deutsch, italiano"
A Google user,4,It Is actually a good platform for learning new language
A Google user,5,Amazing lessons.
A Google user,5,its a really good app :3
A Google user,1,The study reminders are awful. You're shamed for not opening the app when they think you should be. I struggle to build new habits as a lot of people do so I don't need to feel worse about it than I already do.
A Google user,1,I wish they would teach you the words before making completely sentences lol I feel like they just throw you into sentences.
A Google user,5,I really love this app it saved me to practice my English as well
A Google user,5,I'm only doing to get my child back
A Google user,3,"Good program but the Timed lessons do Not provide a way to listen well, repeat well, reply well nor learn well. I understand that speed of what you've learned is good but Correctness is Better. Will not buy but will continue with Duo for now..."
A Google user,5,"Duolingo, famous for its quirky reminders, is as much a memorization game as a language education tool, and that's OK. Play is fun, and comes in bite-sized chunks, perfect for short breaks on the phone when one wants to both have a break, and be virtuous at the same time."
A Google user,5,it is perfect
A Google user,5,he sees you when you miss a lesson. :)
A Google user,5,"Ya se me quito la queja, compre el super duolingo."
A Google user,5,Entertaining. lots of fun. I'd like to build a dictionary of words I've learned.
A Google user,5,Very good. I'm enjoying a lot.
A Google user,2,Duolingo wrecked it when they removed teams!
A Google user,5,Duolingo well I've got to say I absolutely love this app it is super awesome I think out of all the other Spanish learning apps whatever you want to call it you have to pay for a free trial and things like that I don't even have to pay anything not unless I want to get Duolingo super and I really appreciate how this app was made I listen to your podcasts on Spotify although there's something I do not like about this app I think we should get a few more hearts overall it's a good app 💚💚💚💚💚
A Google user,5,جميل
A Google user,5,"It's AMAZING! I'm learning Japanese, Japanese is on of the top 5 hardest languages to learn and I didn't even know it!"
A Google user,2,"Was a one time devotee of this app learning Italian, but now I find I cannot get into the app it freezes and says it's Loading but nothing happens after that."
A Google user,4,This app is so helpful
A Google user,4,"It's good, but also a nightmare when your dyslexic, ended up paying subscription because I'd always run out of hearts because of spelling (why I knocked a star off). It is addictive."
A Google user,5,I love it. I'm learning Arabic.❤❤❤❤😝
A Google user,5,Duo and his friends really help me with my Japanese
A Google user,1,"Like the app, but it doesn't help me in conversation with ppl imagine me saying hello In japanese and don't know what to say next. How to get a friendly conversation with a person is what I aim for but I'm not really getting it.....Also the issues of heart and having to pay is not really making me want to invite others to use this app. And also paying to recheck on your mistake. Arigatou."
A Google user,5,Duolingo is really good and interesting to learning English and others idioms...
A Google user,3,Bien
A Google user,4,I am really enjoying learning french.
A Google user,5,Easy to navigate. Make learning a new language easy.
A Google user,5,i'm sorry Duolingo AAAAAAAA
A Google user,4,Brilliant... if you pay. There are way too many advertisements for anything remotely productive on the free version.
A Google user,5,amazing try now has duolingo max with free adds you can complete 4.6%
A Google user,5,"Love this. I'm studying the languages of the country I was born 🇫🇷 and lived 🇩🇪, As well as 🇪🇸 which is used a lot where I currently reside. Definitely don't like the commercials so I will most likely get the paid app as I continue to progress along"
A Google user,5,"Duolingo app is the best , as a student duolingo has made me to be perfect in french. I also recommend that some student should use duolingo"
A Google user,5,I love it
A Google user,5,is good
A Google user,5,perfect language school
A Google user,4,Good but Boost the heart rates
A Google user,5,Just try it thank me later
A Google user,5,its amazing and free DOWNLOADD NOWW
A Google user,5,"The paid version changes the experience completely. If you want to actually learn, it's a game changer. so easy to get pulled in and it actually feels like I'm learning."
A Google user,5,nice
A Google user,5,Proper learning
A Google user,5,love uuuu
A Google user,5,I love this app. It's the best!!!!!!
A Google user,1,"This used to be the best language learning app but not anymore... now its very bad. From forcing you to mindlessly keep going in expense of actual learning, to having removed valuable community discussions to be replaced by ai for a price, to spikes in difficulity usually after your second lesson in a row and half way into third designed to spend your hearts to force payment... Oh and its not a ""mission"" anymore its a business, fix your ad justification"
A Google user,5,I've only been using this app for 10 days and I'm only committed to 3 min per day (some days I keep playing because it's so fun) and already I can speak some sentences. My 10 year old daughter got excited about it too so she downloaded the app and now we can talk to each other in Spanish (a few simple sentences). She has so much fun on the app that I've made it a time that she can't play until her homework is done. I wish we could gamify her homework too!
A Google user,5,Is fun and you can lean different stuff
A Google user,5,nice ❤
A Google user,5,Good for learning
A Google user,5,just wonderful! I'm enjoying every lesson
A Google user,3,It was fun but also not that helpful
A Google user,5,duolingo scares me
A Google user,5,I love this menace 💕
A Google user,5,very good 💯
A Google user,5,addictive in a good way
A Google user,5,"Duolingo çok güzel bir uygulama, hedeflerini kısa sürede tamamlayabiliyorsun. Herkese tavsiye ediyorum."
A Google user,1,"Duolingo is not free. Its a scam. You pay them to (forced) warch advertisments every day, so many times when you use it. Also you need to PAY MORE, if you dont want to watch ads. Liars. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED to use it at all."
A Google user,5,excellent method
A Google user,4,Membership features are super glitchy
A Google user,5,Nice
A Google user,1,So many ads is literally impossible to focus. You can't learn anything of substance without paying their insane subscription prices anymore. And the AI voices they use now are utter garbage. This app is so much worse these days.
A Google user,5,Easy and self-paced
A Google user,5,Excelent
A Google user,5,very nice app helps me learn more languages
A Google user,5,"it is the best application for learning a language.. good structure , interactive, approachable interface, captivating stories, and it keeps you entertained, while culturally adapted"
A Google user,5,I am having a good time with Duolingo ٩😀۶ 〈😀ノ
A Google user,3,Needs all languages menu and a surprise when finish lesson
A Google user,4,"Very great app, I wish some of the premium features were free tho like explaining my mistake"
A Google user,3,It's Good For Language Learning But BRING BACK PROFILE PICTURES!!! 😭😭😭
A Google user,5,"Duolingo uses many methods to ensure that you are able to read, speak, and understand another language. My kids love it! It is like a game to them that happens to be educational."
A Google user,4,love owl ❤
A Google user,5,it is gooooooooooooooood
A Google user,3,video calls don't respond this is something vital to learning and it's not just my phone I've asked others

A Google user,5,it's cool
A Google user,5,I'm learning Japanese it's so good try it
A Google user,1,It is kinda horrible to lose the streak entirely over a mistake with no way to recover it. Kinda makes me want to quit
A Google user,3,great product overall but I paid for the deluxe version and it stopped the ads but no features worked
A Google user,5,Awesome!

A Google user,5,Ridiculously Brilliant Majestically Awesome What a Fantastic App. Gracias
A Google user,4,"I would like to report a bug, but i dont know where. For some reason in German course section 2 unit 10 last one before completing the unit I'm only getting half the exp (might be due to the app thinking that it has been completed), also for some reason every time i check competition before doing a lesson my lesson gets reset even if i have completed it, i have done it multiple times (~8 by now, but to complete it you only need 3, its been reset 5 times by now). The reseting started 5 days ago."
A Google user,4,"It's pretty good, but would be better if there was Lithuanian for those who want to learn."

A Google user,5,very useful app 💯😸
A Google user,5,👍
A Google user,2,"It's a good app, but why is it that if I mess up 4 times, I can't do anything unless I pay experience. And if I don't understand what I did wrong and get help, I have to pay a subscription, I think the high-school classes are would be a better idea because they want you to learn and they help and not say, no, if you want to do this more you have to pay 1000 experience, they HELP you"

A Google user,5,Nice app
A Google user,4,Good. Kinda creepy But other than that Yeah it's not bad
A Google user,4,Great for learning a new language!
A Google user,5,makes it fun and emersive.
A Google user,5,This app stalks me and knows when to tell me it's study time. lol
A Google user,5,"Wow. Yah just wow. This is amazing, I have been learning italiana for only 30 days and already know over 150 words. this may be the best app I have ever invested in. Although, without paying, you have to watch very short ads, and only have limited lives. This app is truly amazing, thanks duo!"
A Google user,5,This is the best language learning app
A Google user,1,"Was really good, but for some reason after the last update you can no longer do unlimited practice to fill up your hearts. Not sure if this is an accident or if y'all have gotten cheap and want us to pay for hearts. Please fix this. I use the practice to keep up with what I've already learned. Not being able to practice is holding us back!"
A Google user,5,love love love make it fun and challenging to learn something new.
A Google user,5,I LOVE DUO HES ON MY WALLPAPER! PLS DON'T KIDNAP ME LOL LOVE YA BYEE
A Google user,5,amazing app I like it
A Google user,5,it's a good app to learn a Launuage and incorage a friend :)
A Google user,2,"There's a great app in here. Unfortunately it's buried under some of the most predatory ""free to play"" monetization I've ever seen. Pay to be able to access content. Pay to be able to use the app more if you make a mistake while learning. Pay to actually have lessons that explain core concepts like conjugating verbs. It is so deeply user hostile that I would not recommend to anyone except as a way to get suplimentary experience while taking real lessons elsewhere."
A Google user,5,bestt
A Google user,5,لكن تنفع الصحة في دقيقة للاسف
A Google user,2,I can't learn because I don't have hearts it's unfair and I can't learn my lessons because of it
A Google user,5,Good app thank you Duolingo😍🥰😄
A Google user,5,Duolingo didn't have first line by line alphabet I think alphabet is more important 🙂‍↕️and everything is good 😇I'm suggest please line by line alphabet is also important 🫠
A Google user,5,great way to learn Spanish
A Google user,5,"one thing that i cannot get over is the fact that they made this app suited for procrastinators like me, i mean, you can't just ignore duolingo's notifications that easily😂."
A Google user,5,excellent
A Google user,4,"o Duolingo é bom e continuando eles poderiam nos ensinar algo mais avançado, para quem claro tem um inglês mais avançado."

A Google user,5,it is so wonderful . it teaches u any language u like for example I am interested in French evn now I know how to introduce myself in French
A Google user,5,Duolingo is wonderful app please download and improve your spoken English... A to Z
A Google user,5,This app is amazing! it can help you learn so many languages and if you are struggling with something. It knows. It takes time with the harder things. I also love that you can learn almost every language and it even includes MUSIC AS ONE! Thanks duo!

A Google user,1,"Practice to earn hearts is grayed out . I can't use it. & i couldn't pick an option for an answer. I have sent multiple bugs reports & no fix.Support ignores you.Seems like an attempt to force people to buy. How greedy 😕 450 gems to refill is too much!! Ads are also shown, but you get no extra hearts for it!! & hearts take too long to refill.Now that's cold, duolingo! 🥶😡"
A Google user,5,good learning Hindi Language app
A Google user,4,"Although it is a very good app for learning.anyone can learn any language.i love this app but,I am having a small glitch that my league is not showing and my profile is showing private.i even emailed it but no reply.so,I request duilingo operators to look after it.please it is a request."

A Google user,5,really good app
A Google user,5,Great 👌
A Google user,4,"I really like this app but I have noticed that it doesn't explain some things. For example: it has started putting an ""A"" in front of a sentence and it has shortened some words. This is all done without an explanation as to why the changes. It's quite confusing so it makes it more difficult to move forward with my lessons."
A Google user,5,it's the best 🤩

A Google user,2,"The app has completely gone down the drain. The tree, the hearts, the story removal and all has just been pain. But the worst part is the translations being worse and sometimes completey wrong. The 2 stars are just for me using it for so long ."
A Google user,4,Nice app helps a lot for language lover and from my opinion Plz add the languages particular alphabet. Thank you!
A Google user,4,it's a great learning app but so many notifications some are helpful some aren't
A Google user,5,very good app
A Google user,5,very nice
A Google user,1,"There's been a drop in quality recently. They're locking new features behind a second subscription, teasing you with them during the free course and they're adding new listening tasks where the conversation is between text to speech bots, not actual humans. The stressing of words is all wrong and makes learning more difficult."
A Google user,2,"adds everywhere, some of the lessons dont makr sense. useful for very basic learning"
A Google user,5,best app
A Google user,5,App is so cool
A Google user,2,The ads are so annoying There is an ads after every lesson that really annoys me and make me mad I'm thinking of deleting the app I don't have money Duolingo I can't buy anything 💔
A Google user,5,The best😊❤️.
A Google user,5,"I tell you what, I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer or the brightest crayon in the box; but I sure am enjoying learning Chinese and refreshing myself with math. It keeps the mind sharp to continue learning."
A Google user,3,"If you disable animations, the leaderboard does not refresh. Fix that and I'll give you five stars."
A Google user,5,Will rate 5 when Mandarin Chinese becomes available to learn!
A Google user,3,I wish this app scaled horizontally and not just vertically on my Samsung tablet or iPad.
A Google user,5,"I love y'all, the bird is so cute"
A Google user,5,Iam traped in his basement forced to give 5 stars (joke the app is really goood for learning)
A Google user,4,I know Chinese now but it's kinda annoying that you gotta play real money for hearts😵‍💫

A Google user,5,this is so good
A Google user,1,"8th time scraping by to finish a lesson without hearts. Browbeating isn't teaching, repetition of being shown your broke is demoralizing. Apparently I rub my face in mud to keep a streak. Thank you for the indignanty of continual parroting something I don't comprehend, rather than help me conceptualize. Not an app for people with dyslexia, spelling counts, they don't always correct spelling if you're a letter off, which allows you to more easily misspell. 40 min effort somedays, to keep streak."
A Google user,5,It's very funny and easy to learn.
A Google user,5,the very best

A Google user,5,Very interesting and easy to understand I love it

A Google user,5,Great app to learn and practice easily.

A Google user,5,"It is game like, so it is not too intimidating. It allows you to listen sometimes and even say some of the material back to see if you can speak it as well. It is not hard at all if you start on beginner, and it is teaching more in depth than I have experienced before"
A Google user,5,it's super helpful

A Google user,5,I recommend using this app when you want to learn a new language and also.

A Google user,4,"Doulingo is actually an amazing language learning app. I'm currently learning Russian (I also know how to speak polish fluently,) and it is very fun to learn, plus it is very similar to polish, so it is easier for me. The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ads that you occasionally get while finishing a lesson. The ads aren't honestly that annoying it's just I didn't really think doulingo would ever put ads into their app. Otherwise, amazing app to learn a new language."

A Google user,5,this is great
A Google user,5,Nice
A Google user,5,"loving this app and learning so much while having fun. I am learning new words and actually understanding how to conjugate verbs, almost effortlessly."
A Google user,3,"it's a good app to start languages with but it can definitely use some improvement as they don't teach at first a lot of practical expressions and when you get deeper into the courses, it will let you make the same mistake over and over again rather than helping you to figure out why the mistake was made and how to correct it unless you want to pay them a bunch more money. I think that if you really want to learn a language fluently, you need to combine this app with many other resources."
A Google user,1,As a persian speaker i wanted to improve my english but unfortunately you don't have that option. I'm very disappointed in you. Please add the persian language
A Google user,1,Add The urdu & kannada language

A Google user,5,"Terrible for Finnish, complete money grab. (Get word dive if you're learning Finnish.) This app is trash for everything except Spanish. Read the subreddit r/Duolingo. I'm over your cash squeezing policies. You're not in it for any love of language, you're in it for money. I'm done with you. Rated 5 stars so this message will show at top. Really a no stars"

The only things i dont like about duolingo is it takes 5 hours to get one heart and its so annoying you have to have lots of pacince if you want to play this it is also good for stuff like middle and high school like spanish and german and french theres so many words i know now just from this app. Like tchüss means bye so bye.

A Google user,1,"No longer lets you practice to earn hearts, essentially forcing you to pay to use the app. The app was great but This blatant money grab has ruined it."
A Google user,5,Super
A Google user,5,Duolingo is a learning site that encourages continuing a language by turning it into a game i believe this makes it far better than if it were to just be a boring site you would only learn every month

A Google user,3,"fun, but.... I wish it was geared earlier to everyday interactions you would encounter while traveling. ex. restaurants, ordering and asking for the check, finding things in stores , navigating airports where people don't speak English, asking directions, etc. it really misses the mark in being everyday useful to a traveler. also, there are grammar rules that should be explained better for those that want to know the rules. it could be an optional ""tip"" that people could click on."
A Google user,5,superb
A Google user,5,so much fun with Duolingo plus his so cute and adorable and a great weekend 😊 😍 😊 😍 😊 😍 😍 😊 😊 😍 😍 😍 😊 😍 😊 😍 😍

A Google user,5,superb app for learning every language even with adds it is interesting and keeps you going with rewards no matter what thank u duolingo lot of math problems ans are wrong with slider plz fix
A Google user,5,"For people who are struggling with learning languages, this is the PERFECT app for you! Duolingo makes it easier by making step by step progresses, and plus it motivates you by giving you challenges and trying to do at least a lesson a day. There are ads but ads that are for Duolingo's subscription plans like family plans or Max. I would say this is a really good app for learning languages but also maths and music!"

A Google user,4,it's good but you have to pay to mKe your learning better so I don't really like that but over all good becuse some people have other bills to pay an paying for super dualingo then duolingo MAZ came out now I can't get either becuse I have to do other things and no I'm not paying for one free trial for one week over all the learning systems 👍 good
A Google user,5,I like it
A Google user,4,Good
A Google user,4,Some sentences are incorrect but overall it's okay. Also if you're gonna put ads after most free lessons at least make the wait time for hearts shorter so we free folk can get more use out of the app considering it's way too expensive for some people.

A Google user,4,It's a great app but It's teaching me words that I won't necessarily need to use and not the ones I will need to use
A Google user,5,good
A Google user,4,Adarsh
A Google user,5,Diese App ist sehr gut.
A Google user,5,best app

A Google user,5,the best😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
A Google user,1,New Duolingo SUCKS!!!!! Doing everything they can to force users to spend money and upgrade. I'm so mad I would give just about any other language app developer my money other than Duo.

A Google user,5,very good game 👍

A Google user,5,"This app is literally good. It helped me so much with my language subjects at school. I usually learn Chinese. This app is simple, fun to engage in and good cayse it contains achievements and everything. But it really needs to add SINHALA LANGUAGE. I would love to see my mother language here, cause all I know is that the sinhala language is fun to learn and not that hard......it's a suggestion though......😇🥰 Thanks duo!"
A Google user,5,quick and easy!! it's the best 👍😁
A Google user,5,super Duolingo
A Google user,5,"it's the best so far,I will recommend it to anyone that wants to learn any language."
A Google user,5,so good 💯
A Google user,4,"Seems to be a nice app for learning a language with some small bugs: When translating to English or German, there are often multiple correct word orders, but the app expects a specific word order. The app does allow to right away feedback on this, so I hope that will be fixed soon, then I will update to 5 stars."
A Google user,4,Good app
